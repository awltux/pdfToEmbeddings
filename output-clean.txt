Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Section 0 -  General  
0.1 Application  
0.1.1  Introduction 
The Building (Scotland) Act 2003 gives Scottish Ministers the power to make building 
regulations to:  
* secure  the health, safety, welfare and convenience of persons in or about buildings 
and of others who may be affected by buildings or matters connected with buildings  
* further the conservation of fuel and power and 
* further the achievement of sustainable development.  
This document gives guidance on how to comply with these regulations.  
This is one of two Technical Handbooks, one covering domestic buildings and the other 
non-domestic buildings. These Technical Handbooks have been issued by Scottish 
Ministers for the purpose of providing practical guidance with respect to the requirements 
of the provisions of the building regulations under a notice given in accordance with 
Section 4(2) of the Building (Scotland) Act 2003. Each Handbook has eight sections. 
Section 0, this secti on, is identical in both Handbooks. It covers general issues and sets 
out how and when the regulations apply to buildings and works.  
From the 2013 edition onwards, the Handbooks are published electronically and are 
available free on the Scottish Government , Building Standards Division website . 
Sections 1 to 7 give guidance on how to achieve the standards set by the re gulations, and 
there are different sets for domestic buildings and non- domestic buildings. The seven 
sections each cover a number of related standards. They are:  
* Section 1 Structure  
* Section 2 Fire  
* Section 3 Environment  
* Section 4 Safety  
* Section 5 Noise  
* Section 6 Energy  
* Section 7 Sustainability  
Each of the seven sections consists of an introduction and then general guidance on the 
standards within the section. This is followed by each standard which has specific 
introductory information and guidance on how to comply with the standard. At the of the 
Handbook, after Section 7, there are the following two sections:  
* Appendix A: Defined terms.  
* Appendix B: List of standards and other publications.  
The Technical Handbooks are supported by a Procedural Handbook, publi shed 
separately, which clarifies the intent of the Building (Scotland) Procedures Regulations 
################# - Page 4 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 4 Applicable from 5  June 2023   2004. A separate procedural guidance document for Cr own buildings has also been 
produced.  
0.1.2  The Building (Scotland) Regulations  2004  
This Technical Handbook gives guidance on achieving the standards set in the Building 
(Scotland) Regulations. The standards themselves can be found in schedule 5 to 
regulation 9 , and are in the form of 'expanded functional standards'. That is, the standards 
describe the functions a building should perform, such as 'providing resistance to the 
spread of fire'.  
The Building (Scotland) Regulations made by the Scottish Ministers are subject to 
approval by the Scottish Parliament. The content of the regulations, so far as it relates to 
technical specifications, is also scrutinised by the European Commission (EC). The EC 
checks with all the other countries that have adopted the Construction Products 
Regulations (CPR) to ensure that no barriers to trade in construction products are created , 
either directly or indirectly by the way products are described.  
To meet the requirements of the CPR, materials and construction methods must be 
described by use of suitable European Standards wherever these exist. As there is a 
rolling programme of chan ge to these National and European Standards, which includes 
conversion to, and the further provision of, ENs and harmonised ENs, the Handbooks 
have been designed to be readily updated. An explanation of the relevance and status of 
specific European and Bri tish standards referred to in the Handbooks is in the section 
concerned. There is also a list of the publications referred to in the Handbooks provided in 
Appendix B.  
The arrangement of Sections 1 -  7 within the Handbooks relates directly to the Basic 
Works Requirements of the CPR (as published by the EC), which construction works are 
expected to satisfy when they have been properly designed and built. The arrangement is 
as follows:  
* Section 1 Structure (EC -  Mechanical resistance and stability)  
* Section  2 Fire (EC -  Safety in case of fire)  
* Section 3 Environment (EC -  Hygiene, health and the environment)  
* Section 4 Safety (EC -  Safety and accessibility in use)  
* Section 5 Noise (EC -  Protection against noise)  
* Section 6 Energy (EC -  Energy, economy and heat retention)  
* Section 7 Sustainability (EC -  Sustainable use of natural  resources)  
0.1.3  The building standards  system  
The building regulations are enforced through the building standards system that is 
established by The Building (Scotland) Act 2003 . The Act sets out the enabling powers 
that allow Scottish Ministers to make, not only the building regulations, but also procedural 
regulations, fees regulations and the other supporting legislation needed to operate the 
system. The system is designed to ensure that new buildings and works achieve the 
objectives of the Act in terms of health, safety, welfare, convenience, conservation of fuel 
and power, and sustainable development.  
################# - Page 5 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 5 Applicable from 5  June 2023   The roles of those operating the building standards system are explained in detail in the 
guidance on the procedural regulations. Briefly, the duty to comply with the building 
regulations lies with the owner, or in some cases the client, for the work. Before work 
begins a building warrant must be obtained.  
For some simpler works a warrant is not required (see regulation 5 and schedule 3), but 
the regulations still apply. The owner or client again has the duty to comply. The role of 
issuing  warrants and accepting completion certificates rests with verifiers, enforcement is 
by local authorities, and the system is overseen and updated by the Building Standards 
Division (BSD). BSD forms part of the Scottish Government and acts on behalf of, and is 
responsible to, Scottish Ministers. These bodies are further explained in the guidance to 
the procedural regulations.  
The building standards system is pre- emptive, ensuring so far as possible that the 
proposed works will comply with the regulations. It  recognises that proposals can change 
during construction, so there are requirements for amendments to the proposals to be 
agreed and recorded. On completion, the owner or client must certify that the works have 
been constructed in accordance with the buil ding warrant and the building regulations.  
The verifier will make reasonable inquiry to ensure the completion certificate is accurate 
before accepting the certificate. Usually an inspection of the works will be made, and  on 
most projects some inspection of work in progress will also have been carried out. 
However verifiers cannot inspect all materials and work on every building site. It is the 
client that should put in place the contractual and practical arrangements needed to assure 
themselves that the de sired quality of work has been achieved.  
0.1.4  Status of Technical  Handbooks  
The regulations are mandatory, but the choice of how to comply lies with the building 
owner. This Technical Handbook has been issued by Scottish Ministers, through the 
Building St andards Division, for the purpose of providing practical guidance with respect to 
the building regulations. If the guidance is followed in full then this should be accepted by 
the verifier as indicating that the building regulations have been complied with. However it 
is quite acceptable to use alternative methods of compliance provided they fully satisfy the 
regulations.  
Failure to comply with the Technical Handbook does not render a person liable to civil or 
criminal procedures, but proof of compliance with the guidance may be relied on in any 
proceedings as tending to negative liabili ty for an alleged contravention of the building 
regulations.  
Following the advice in the Technical Handbooks is therefore likely to be the normal way of 
complying with the building regulations. However, a designer may put forward other ways 
of meeting the regulations, in the form of alternative solutions.  
There are a further three guidance documents that have the same standing as the 
Technical Handbooks. Scottish Ministers have issued these under Section 4(1) of the 
Building (Scotland) Act 2003. These are:  
* Guide for Practitioners 6: Conversion of Traditional Buildings , published by Historic 
Scotland,  
* Guide for practitioners 7: Fire Safety Management in Traditional Buildings , publish ed 
by Historic Scotland, and  
################# - Page 6 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 6 Applicable from 5  June 2023   * Conservatories Guide 2nd Edition , published by the Building Standards Division.  
In due course other documents  may be issued by Scottish Ministers to provide further 
guidance. Such guidance might deal with specific building types, or provide alternative 
methods of showing compliance with those provided in the Technical Handbooks.  
0.1.5  Alternative  solutions  
The us e of expanded functional standards, backed up by detailed guidance, provides a 
flexible system of control. Consideration of alternative solutions is assisted by the 
expansion of the functional standards previously used in the building standards regulations  
to clarify the necessary properties of each building. The need for a formal relaxation of 
standards is reduced as meeting the full details of given solutions is no longer mandatory. 
The professional judgement of the verifier, assisted by guidance on quest ions referred to 
Scottish Ministers, through the Building Standards Division, decides whether a standard is 
met. 
In considering alternative solutions, however it is necessary to have regard to the details of 
this guidance. Where performance standards or policy statements are given, every part of 
the solution is expected to meet them. As a result, alternative solutions that appear 
suitable may not be acceptable in detail. For example, some of the solutions offered in 
relation to the English and Welsh building regulations, in the 'Approved Documents' (ADs), 
are not suitable because the levels of thermal insulation recommended are not the same. 
Similarly different approaches are taken to the control of fire size and the design of 
compartmentation which means th at constructions meeting the AD on fire safety may not 
be acceptable. This will vary in time as both ADs and the Scottish Technical Handbooks 
are updated. Solutions based on other documents, such as British or European Standards, 
will have to be carefully evaluated to see if the Scottish standards are being met in an 
appropriate manner.  
0.1.6  Domestic and non-domestic  buildings  
Where any building contains both domestic uses and non- domestic uses, the appropriate 
parts from each Technical Handbook will need to be used to ensure the standards are 
complied with in full, for example a caretakers flat in an office building. However, 
communal rooms or other areas in a block of dwellings that are exclusively associated with 
the dwellings should be considered using the domestic guidance. Examples of this might 
be a room used as an office for the operation of a sheltered housing complex or a lounge 
communal to a block of dwellings. It is also a general principle that where a building or part 
of a building might be seen as falling into more than one category it should be designed to 
meet the most stringent recommendations.  
0.1.7  Latest  changes  
The following is a summary of the changes to this section which have been introduced 
from 5  June 2023. Very minor changes to text have not been included here.  
* 0.12.2 - New standard 7.2  added to schedule 6.  
 
 
################# - Page 7 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 7 Applicable from 5  June 2023   0.1.8  Updating 
It is intended that this Technical Handbook will be available in electronic form and 
available free of charge on the Building Standards Division website - 
www.gov.scot/policies/building- standards/ . It is not expected that the standards will change 
regularly as these are set in the building regulations and can only be changed with 
Parliamentary approval. Therefore it is anticipated that the guidance will be replaced more 
regul arly than the standards themselves.  
0.1.9  Arrangement of Section  0 
Section 0 is arranged to follow the actual regulations. This sub- section provides an 
introduction to the building standards system. Sub- section 0.2 covers regulations 1 and 2 
which are the citation, commencement and interpretation. Sub- sections 0.3 to 0.15 cover 
the significant technical regulations with each sub- section setting out and discussing the 
regulation with the same number (sub- section 0.3 covering regulation 3 etc.). Regulation 
16 establishes which regulations cannot ever be relaxed by Scottish Ministers. These are 
the regulations on citation and commencement, interpretation, exempted buildings, work 
not requiring a warrant and the methods of measurement. Regulation 17 was introduc ed in 
2007 to help with the implementation of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive.  
0.1.10  Certification  
Scottish Ministers can, under Section 7 of the Building (Scotland) Act 2003, approve 
schemes for the certification of design or construction f or compliance with the mandatory 
functional standards. Such schemes are approved on the basis that the procedures 
adopted by the scheme will take account of the need to co- ordinate the work of various 
designers and specialist contractors. Individuals approved to provide certification services 
under the scheme are assessed to ensure that they have the qualifications, skills and 
experience required to certify compliance for the work covered by the scope of the 
scheme. Checking procedures adopted by Approved C ertifiers will deliver design or 
installation reliability in accordance with legislation.

Regulation 1  
These regulations may be cited as the Building (Scotland) Regulations 2004 and 
shall co me into force on 1 May 2005.  
Regulation 2  
Regulation 2 sets out the defined terms within the regulations. It is not 
reproduced in Section 0; instead the terms have been incorporated in the list of 
defined terms which form Appendix A . 
 
 
0.2.1  Explanation of  Regulation 1 
Regulation 1 contains the citation and commencement of the building regulations. They 
apply to buildings and works as defined in The Building (Scotland) Act 2003, other than 
works exempted by regulation 3, schedule 1. The full text is:  
The Act defines a building as any structure or erection, whether temporary or 
permanent. This is very wide, but there are exceptions in The Act for:  
* any public road (including any bridge on which the road is carried)  
* any private road (bridges on private roads are not excluded in The Act)  
* any sewer or water main vested in Scottish Water  
* any aerodrome runway  
* any railway line  
* any large raised reservoir within the meaning of the Reservoirs Act 1975  
* any wires and cables, their supports above ground and other apparat us used for 
telephonic or telegraphic communications.  
The term building is, subject to context, taken to include a prospective building, a part of a 
building and, for extensions, alterations and conversions, it can mean the extension alone 
or the part subject to alteration or conversion. Works in relation to a building is defined in 
The Act as including works carried out in relation to the enclosure and preparation of the 
site. Works therefore includes all construction, demolition and conversion work, t he 
provision of services fittings and equipment, and any work carried out in relation to the site.  
The Building (Scotland) Regulations 2004  apply to all buildings and works where an 
application for warrant is made on or after 1 May 2005. In the case of a Crown building, 
the regulations apply to all buildings and work where an application for warrant is made on 
or after 1 May 2009. However, full exemption fr om the building standards system is 
provided for defence and national security buildings in legislation under The Building 
(Scotland) Act 2003 (Exemptions for Defence and National Security) Order 2009 , SI 2009 
No.822 (S.6).  
################# - Page 9 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 9 Applicable from 5  June 2023   The Building (Scotland) Act 2003 (Commencement No.2 and Transitional Provisions) 
Order 2009 allows work to Crown buildings that has started prior to 1 May 2009 to 
continue with immunity from building regulations. In addition, work carried out pursuant to 
a contract entered into prior to 1 May 2009 will continue with immunity on the basis that 
work commenced before 1 November 2009. In both cases, work must be complete before 
1 May 2012.  
Buildings and works related to earlier warrant applications or exempt works commencing 
before 1 May 2005 are subject to previous building standards and procedures regulations, 
in particular the time by when these works must be completed. Previously exempt works, 
in particular any no longer exempt, must have been completed by 2 September 2005, 
otherwise the exemption falls and a warrant for any outstanding work may be required.  
On completion of the works, before the period specified in the building warrant expires, a 
completion certificate must be submitted. If a completion certificate is submitted for work 
done without a warrant, the regulations that are applicable are those in force at the time of 
submission of the certificate, which may well be more onerous that those which would 
have applied when the work started. Fuller details of the arrangements for subm itting 
warrant applications and completion certificates will be given in the guidance on the 
procedure regulations.  
The building regulations also incorporate requirements previously set in separate Building 
Operations Regulations (regulations 13- 15). These cover the provision of protective works, 
clearing of footpaths and securing of unoccupied buildings.

0.2.2  Explanation of Regulation 2 
Regulation 2 sets out the defined terms within the regulations. It is not reproduced in 
Section 0, instead the terms have been incorporated in the list of defined terms which form 
Appendix A. The Appendix also includes definitions from the Building (Scotland) Act 2003 
and those used in these Technical Handbooks.  
In the determination of the description of a building, any use which is ancillary to another 
use or which is of a minor nature should be disregarded and the building taken to be that 
of the principal description. Minor uses within the curtilage of a dwelling may also be 
disregarded, for example a single- room office for use by up to two people. Notwithstanding 
the above, parts of a building may be considered to be of a separate description where the 
context requires (for example a caretakers flat should be taken separately from any other 
part of the building in which it is located).  
A dwelling may include any surgeries, consulting rooms, offices or other accommodation, 
of a floor area not exceeding in the aggregate 50 square metres, forming part of the 
dwelling and used by an occupant of the dwelling in a professional or business capacity. A 
dwelling may provide bed and breakfast facilities provided this does not exceed two double 
bedrooms and is not in use for more than half of the year.  
Where further guidance on building types is needed to define the proposals for particular 
buildings, it is included in the relevant section.

Page 12 Applicable from 5  June 2023   0.3 Exempted buildings and services, fittings 
and equipment  
Regulation 3  
1. Regulations 8 to 12 shall not apply to any building or any services, 
fittings and equipment the whole of which falls into any one or more of 
the exempted types described in schedule 1.  
2. The provision of:  
a) services, fittings and equipment to, or the demolition or removal of, 
exempted buildings is exempt, and  
b) services, fittings and equipment to, or the demolition of, exempted 
services, fittings and equipment is exempt.  
3. For the purposes of this regulation, for the avoidance of doubt, each 
such exempted type does  not include any of the exceptions expressed 
in relation to that type.  
 
 
0.3.1  Explanation 
Regulation 3 and schedule 1 set out what buildings and work are exempted from the 
building regulations. The general principles applied to establish exemption are that the 
regulations do not need to apply where:  
* other legislation covers the buildings or work (types 1 -  3) 
* the buildings or work are covered by another regulation (type 4) 
* the buildings or work are not normally frequented by people (types 5 -  8) 
* the buildi ngs or work are so separated that the regulations are largely inappropriate, 
and are likely in any case to be supervised by specialists including civil engineers 
(types 9 -  12) 
* the buildings or work are sufficiently minor that they have little or no impact  on the 
public interest and it is not in the public interest to seek to enforce the regulations 
(types 13 -  15 and 17 - 21) 
* the buildings or work are temporary (type 16). 
Particular care is necessary where exempted work is in the vicinity of, or attached t o, an 
existing building. The level of compliance of the existing building with building regulations 
should not be adversely affected when exempt works are undertaken.  
Where exempt work requires that alteration is made to an existing building to maintain the 
level of compliance with building regulations, a building warrant may be required. For 
example where it is intended to construct a porch, which falls within type 18, over an 
accessible entrance and a new accessible entrance is required.

Page 18 Applicable from 5  June 2023   0.4 Changes in the occupation or use of a 
building that cause the regulations to apply  
Regulation 4  
For the purposes of section 56(1) of the Act and these regulations, the changes 
in occupation or use of buildings set out in schedule 2 shall be conversions to 
the extent specified by regulation 12.  
 
 
0.4.1  Explanation 
The building regula tions always apply where construction occurs, unless exempted by 
regulation 3, and construction includes alterations and extensions as well as entirely new 
buildings. When there is a conversion it will be necessary to seek a warrant and possibly 
to undertake works to improve the standards of the building, or part of the building, 
concerned.  
Regulation 4 and schedule 2 set out what changes of occupation or use of a building are 
defined as conversions and for which the owner must obtain a warrant before making the 
change. The warrant for a conversion will only be granted if the standards set out in 
regulation 12 are achieved and this might well require building  works.  
Those changes of use or occupation listed in schedule 2 are those which are considered 
critical due to the risks involved. They relate to:  
a. domestic buildings, for  example:  
* a hotel to a dwelling (type 1) 
* use of an attic space as a room within a dwelling (type 1) 
* use of a garage attached to a dwelling as a room (type 2) 
* sub-division of a house into two flats (type 3) 
* use of a house as shared residential accommodation (type 4) 
b. residential buildings, for  example:  
* use of a hotel as office (type 5) 
* use of a hotel as a resident ial care home (type 6)  
* use of offices as a backpackers hostel (type  7) 
c. whether a building falls within the exemptions of schedule 1, for  example:  
* use of a railway signal box as a house (type 8) 
d. public access to buildings, for  example:  
* development of a retail trade in a storage building (type 9) 
e. division of a building into different occupancies, for  example:  
* use of a single shop to provide space for two different occupancies (type 10). 
################# - Page 19 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 19 Applicable from 5  June 2023   Type 6 in schedule 2 refers to the significant alterations in the type and the number of 
expected occupants. A significant alteration of type could be considered to occur when 
there was a significant change in the mobility, the familiarity with building, or the 
awareness of danger, of the occupants. For example, signific antly different types would 
include:  
* patients receiving care and/or treatment in a residential care  home/hospital  
* children in a residential institution or residential school  
* guest in a hotel  
* people held in lawful detention.  
A significant alteration in numb er could be considered to occur where it amounted to an 
increase greater than 25%.  
Type 9 in schedule 2 refers to allowing access by the general public where previously 
there was none. Access by the general public refers to permitting members of the general 
public to enter a building during opening hours and allowing them to access all parts of the 
building, other than those parts restricted to staff only.  
For conversions it is the intention that the standards achieved in the converted building 
should be br oadly similar to those achieved by entirely new buildings. Schedule 6 to 
regulation 12 guides the verifier as to where discretion is expected to be necessary. It 
identifies those standards where it is not expected to be reasonably practicable to have 
existing buildings fully comply. However for these standards improvement of the existing 
building is expected where it is reasonably practicable. This means that matters such as 
thermal insulation now have to be improved even if meeting the full standard is not  
practically achievable. Guidance on what is normally reasonably practicable is given in 
schedule 6 and in the individual sections. Guidance is also given on the treatment of 
historic buildings.  
It is also relevant that the requirements of other legislatio n, for example regulations made 
under Health and Safety at Work or licensing legislation, will apply to changes of use, so 
that risk assessments of changed circumstances will provide protection to the occupants of 
buildings.

2. Changes in the occupation or use of a building ancillary to a dwelling to increase the area of human occupation.  
3. Changes in the occupation or use of a building which alters the number of dwellings in the building.  
4. Changes in the occupation or use of a domestic building to any other type of building.

alteration to the characteristics of the persons who occupy, or who will occupy, the 
building, or which significantly increase the number of people occupying, or expected 
to occupy, the building.  
7. Changes in the occupation or use of a building so that it becomes a residential building.  
8. Changes in the occupation or use of an exempt building (in t erms of schedule 1) to a 
building which is not so exempt.  
9. Changes in the occupation or use of a building to allow access by the public where 
previously there was none.  
10. Changes in the occupation or use of a building to accommodate parts in different 
occupation where previously it was not so occupied.

Page 21 Applicable from 5  June 2023   0.5 Buildings work, services, fittings and 
equipment not requiring a  warrant  
Regulation 5  
For the purposes of section 8 (8) of the Act , any work which consists solely of a 
building or conversion , including the provision of services, fittings or  
equipment, of a kind specified in schedule 3, shall meet the standards required 
by regulations 8 to 12 but shall not, subject to the exceptions and conditions, 
require a warrant.  
 
 
0.5.1  Explanation 
Regulation 5 and schedule 3 specifies what work can be done without the need to obtain a 
building warrant. However such work must still comply with the regulations.  
Building type 1 means much more work to or in houses  does not need a warrant. This 
could include:  
* work external to, but immediately adjoining, the house (e.g. patio, decking, wall, fence, 
steps or ramp)  
* small penetrations of the external walls or roof (e.g. balanced flues, sanitary pipework, 
mechanical extr act ducts or vent  pipes)  
* small attachments to the external walls (e.g. canopies or  micro -renewables)  
* erection, demolition or alteration of non- loadbearing partitions  
* electrical  work  
* an en- suite bathroom or shower room (including associated drainage)  
* a cent ral heating system.  
The exceptions are intended to safeguard against changes that might have significant 
effect, such as the removal of structural walls. The following list provides some examples 
of the various exceptions:  
* increasing the floor area of the house (e.g. creation of a mezzanine floor or the infill of 
a stair well)  
* demolition or alteration of the roof (e.g. forming a dormer window or construction of a 
masonry chimney through the roof) 
* demolition or alteration of the external walls (e.g. slapping a new window or door, 
applying an external wall cladding system). The guidance in clause 2.7.1 to standard 
2.7 explains the meaning of external wall cladding system including the various 
component parts that could make up the system.  
* demolition or alterat ion of an element of structure (e.g. removal of a loadbearing wall) 
* work adversely affecting a separating wall (e.g. installing recessed electrical  sockets)  
################# - Page 22 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 22 Applicable from 5  June 2023   * work involving a change to wastewater discharge (e.g. disconnection from the mains 
system).  
The exc eption about increasing the floor area applies because there will be significant 
implications arising from such work. Other changes, such as the development of a roof 
space or a garage as habitable space are conversions in terms of regulation 4, a warrant 
is required and the standards also apply. Where a roof space has limited boarding inserted 
to allow access to services or to allow attic storage, or where the removal of a non-  
loadbearing wall creates a marginal increase in floor area these should not be considered 
as increasing the floor area.  
Building type 2 -  buildings, other than domestic buildings or residential buildings, where 
the public are not normally admitted are granted a similar concession in type 2, allowing 
many offices and factories for exa mple, to make the kind of small alterations necessary to 
accommodate changes in production or process. Again, however, the building work done 
should be to the standard of the building regulations. Exemptions under type 2 recognise 
security concerns relating to a prison, a building where a person may be legally detained 
or legally held in custody, the Scottish Parliament and property owned by Her Majesty in 
right of Her private estates.  
Thus, types 1 and 2 permit virtually any work to be carried out to 1 or 2 storey houses and 
to non- domestic buildings not more than 7.5 m high, other than the exceptions listed.  
Building types 3 - 23 - the broad types described above are followed by types 3 to 23 
covering more specific work that can be carried out to a wider r ange of buildings without 
restricting the work allowed by types 1 and 2. Types 3 to 23 begin with small buildings, 
particularly those within the curtilage of dwellings (types 4 and 5). Note that some of these 
may now be in the curtilage of flats or maisonettes provided they are a sufficient distance 
from the dwellings. A sanitary facility should not be considered to be a wet -floor shower 
room and such work is not intended to be covered by type 11.  
Building Type 17 -  the exception to type 17 is intended to apply to any thermal insulation 
material associated with the application of an external wall cladding system. The guidance 
in clause 2.7.1 explains the meaning of external wall cladding system including the various 
component parts that could make up the sys tem. 
Building type 23A -  a building, used for shelter or sleeping in connection with recreation. 
This building type is different from other building types in schedule 3 in that they must 
comply with the requirements of standards 1.1, 3.17 - 3.22 and 4.4. Exceptions are added 
to recognise galleries, proximity to buildings and boundaries.  
Building types 24 - 26 - are different in that they cover work that is closer to a repair than 
new work. These replacements are therefore required to be to a standard no worse than 
the existing, rather than to the standard for completely new work.  
Doors, windows and rooflights which are a complete replacement are not considered to be 
a repair and have to meet the full requirements of the standards (see type 20). For his toric 
buildings, where there is a specific need to match existing doors, windows or rooflights, the 
principle of 'like for like' may still be permitted.  
Type 25A limits the exemption for replacement external wall cladding systems to minor 
repairs that can be carried out to a standard no worse than existing.  
As a consequence of this new type, the reference to cladding in type 25 has been omitted.  
################# - Page 23 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 23 Applicable from 5  June 2023   In relation to work to external wall cladding systems, minor repair means isolated repair or 
replacement of eleme nts of cladding which are physically damaged or have degraded to 
the point that the element is no longer fit for its intended purpose.  
The changes to type 17 and 25 are intended to safeguard against rapid fire spread on or 
within external wall cladding sys tems.  
Refer also to requirements specific to work undertaken on cladding systems under 
regulation 8.

years is hereby specified.  
 
 
0.6.1  Explanation 
Regulation 6 deals with constructions that are intended to have only a short life span on 
site and in view of this the mandatory standards and associated guidance give some 
concessions to such buildings. These concessions only apply to buildings which are not 
dwellings.  
Standard 3.1 in schedule 5 allows a lesser standard for the treatment of the site of a 
limited life building, other than a dwelling.  
Section 6 Energy, indicates that less demanding U -values can be adopted for the 
insulation envelope of certain types of limited life buildings, other than dwellings and 
residential buildings.  
Section  7 Sustainability, does not apply to these limited life buildings.

"substantial layer" means a layer is one which is at least 1  mm thick or has a 
mass per unit area of at least 1 kg per m2.  
 
 
0.8.1  Explanation 
Regulation 8 applies to all building work, and requires that materials, fittings and 
components used in the constr uction of buildings should be suitable for their purpose, 
correctly used or applied, and sufficiently durable, taking account of normal maintenance 
practices, to meet the requirements of these regulations. For example, external timber 
cladding for low -rise buildings that is readily accessible and replaceable need not be as 
durable as that which is to be used at a higher level on medium -rise buildings.  
It also implements the European Regulation 305/2011/EU Construction Products 
Regulation (CPR), in force on 1 July 2013 that replaces the current Construction Products 
Directive (89/106/EEC). This Regulation requires that products covered by a harmonised 
European product standard or conforming to a European Technical Assessment should 
normally have CE marking.  
The intention of the guidance below is to provide adequate flexibility to accommodate new 
techniques as well as proven traditional practices. This guidance ensures acceptance of 
products which satisfy the basic works requirements of the CPR to avoid barrier s to trade. 
For example, products bearing a CE mark (European Mark of Conformity) must be 
################# - Page 33 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 33 Applicable from 5  June 2023   accepted as meeting regulation requirements where the declaration of performance 
satisfies the requirement and the product is being correctly used.  
Sections 1 -  7 of the Technical Handbooks are arranged to equate with the 7 basic works 
requirements of the CPR. This should aid assessment of products against the regulation 
requirements. There may however be other Directives applicable to certain products or 
constructions . 
A verifier may only reject CE marked products if the declaration of performance does not 
meet the regulation requirement or the products are being incorrectly used. If the verifier 
rejects a product the relevant trading standards officer should be notifi ed. This is a 
requirement of the CPR, and will enable the UK government, where necessary, to notify 
the European Commission.  
It should be noted that CE marking alone does not show compliance with the building 
regulations, as the CE mark may be showing compliance with other Directives or 
Regulations applicable to certain products or constructions. For example, a self contained 
smoke alarm, manufactured in accordance with the Electro Magnetic Compatibility 
Directive should be accepted as satisfying requirements only insofar as they relate to 
prevention of electromagnetic disturbances by, and prevention against disturbances to, 
such smoke alarms.  
External wall cladding systems and specified attachments -  There may be a risk of 
fire spread on the external wall of a building due to the presence of combustible external 
wall cladding systems or specified attachments. Fire could break out through a window or 
door opening and spread onto the external walls. External walls close to the boundary are 
also at risk as they  may be exposed to direct flame impingement or radiant heat flux from a 
fire in an adjoining building or other external source e.g. bin fire.  
Fire-fighters may not be able to apply a water jet from a fire- fighting hose directly onto a 
fire that has spread onto an external wall cladding system or specified attachment high 
above the ground. This is because the external wall is either inaccessible or is out with the 
reach capability of fire- fighting equipment. Therefore, the construction and materials used 
on facades of taller buildings should not contribute to the fire development. The 11m storey 
height in Regulation 8 and in the guidance to standard 2.4 (cavities) and standard 2.7 
(spread on external walls) is based on the reach capability of a fire and rescue service 
ground mounted water jet where there is sufficient pressure and flow in the water main. 
More detailed guidance on the meaning of ext ernal wall cladding system and specified 
attachment is provided in the guidance to standard 2.7 in section 2: Fire of the Technical 
Handbooks.  
0.8.2  Explanation of  terms 
There are useful terms and acronyms used in this section included below.  
BSI - The Bri tish Standards Institution is the UK national standards body. BSI publishes 
European standards in the UK as BS EN. See http://www.bsi.org.uk  . 
CEN - Comite Europeen de Normalisation is the European standards body that 
prepares harmonised product standards. Declarations of Performance against such 
standards are expected to provide sufficient information for any member state to allow  the 
product onto their market and for specifiers and users to be able to assess whether the 
product is suitable for its intended use.  
################# - Page 34 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 34 Applicable from 5  June 2023   CEN also prepares non- harmonised European standards, such as test or calculation 
standards and standards for products or services that have not been mandated under a 
CE Marking Directive.  
CEN does not issue standards directly, only through national standards bodies; BSI is the 
designated standards body for the UK. Further information is available at 
http:// www.cen.eu/cen . 
EA - The European co- operation on Accreditation is the umbrella organisation for all 
National Accreditation Bodies in Europe. Product certification bodies, inspection bodies 
and test laboratories approved by  national accreditation bodies belonging to EA are 
equivalent to those approved by UKAS . See http://www.european- accreditation.org/ . 
ETA - European Technical Assessment s is a favourable technical assessment issued 
under the European Construction Products Regulation 2011 that allows a manufacturer to 
affix CE markings on their products. See http://www.eota.eu/ . 
ISO - International Organization for Standardization is the worldwide federation of 
national standards institutions. Standards are identified by ' ISO' and a number. ISO 
standards may be published separately or transposed into the UK as BS ISO or BS EN 
ISO. See http://www.iso.org/ . 
Materials - include manufactured products such as components, fittings, items of 
equipment and systems. Naturally occurring materials such as stone, ti mber and thatch, 
and backfilling for excavations in connection with building work are also included.  
NANDO - New Approach Notified and Designated Organisations is an information 
system produced by the European Commission. It lists the harmonised European 
standards and bodies notified by member states to carry out conformity assessment tasks 
for CE marking. See http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/newapproach/nando . 
UKAS - United Kingdom Accreditation Service is the sole national accreditation body 
recognised by the UK Government to assess against internationally agreed standards, 
organisations that provide certification, testing, inspection and calibration services. 
Accreditation by UKAS demonstrates the competence, impartiality and performance 
capability of these organisations. See http://www.ukas.com/ . 
Verifier - the role of the verifier is to protect the public interest by providing an independent 
check of applications for building warrant to construct or demolish buildings, to provide 
services, fittings or equipment in buildings, or to convert buildings. Verifiers are appointed 
by Scottish Minist ers. 
0.8.3  Performance  
Regulation 8 will be met if the following are satisfied:  
a. materials used in the construction of buildings are of a suitable nature, quality and in 
relation to the purposes and conditions of their use, and  
b. workmanship is such that, where relevant, materials are adequately mixed or prepared 
and applied, used or fixed so as to perform suitably the functions for which they are 
intended.  
Materials include:  
a. manufactured products such as components, fittings, items of equipment and systems  
################# - Page 35 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 35 Applicable from 5  June 2023   b. naturally occurring materials such as stone, timber and thatch, and  
c. backfilling for excavations in connection with building work.  
0.8.4  Materials  
Building work must meet the functional requirements of Schedule 5 of the Building 
(Scotland) Regulations 2004, as amended. The Technical Handbooks refer to materials 
covered by European harmonised product standards, British Standards, and other 
technical specifications. However, as there is no obligation to adopt any particular solution 
contained in the Technical Handbooks in order to meet functional requirements, the 
references are not exclusive and other materials may be suitable in the particular 
circumstances.  
0.8.5  Ways of establishing the fitness of  materials  
The fitness and suitability of a material for use for a specific purpose can be assessed in 
the following number of ways.  
* CE marking under the CPR  
Many materials are construction products that have CE marking under the CPR 
(305/2011/EU -CPR).  
The CPR requires that construction products on the EU market cov ered by a 
harmonised European product standard should normally have CE marking. In addition, 
manufacturers of products not covered by a harmonised standard can choose to affix 
CE marking to their products by obtaining a European Technical Assessment. You c an 
find a list of the harmonised product standards under the CPR on the NANDO 
information system.   
CE marking includes the reference of the product standard and levels or classes of 
performance being declared against some or all of the characteristics covered by the 
standard. The CE marking should be on the product, its label, the packaging or  
accompanying documents. The CE symbol by itself does not necessari ly indicate that 
the material is suitable for building work.  
In addition to CE marking, the product will have a declaration of performance 
containing more detailed information on the product. This may be a paper or electronic 
document, or it may be on a website. It is essential to check that the declared 
performance is suitable for building work.  
In the absence of indications to the contrary, the verifier should assume that the 
information given in the CE marking and declaration of performance is accurate a nd 
reliable, and that the product meets the declared performances.  
If the declared performance of a product is suitable for its intended use, the verifier 
should not prohibit or impede the use of the product.  
* CE marking under other EU Directives and Regula tions  
Products may have CE marking under other European legislation, such as the Gas 
Appliances Directive (2009/142/EC) or the Pressure Equipment Directive (97/23/EC). 
Such CE marking shows that the product meets the essential requirements set out in 
################# - Page 36 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 36 Applicable from 5  June 2023   the legislation, for example, minimum safety requirements, and can be placed on the 
EU market.  
Some products will have CE marking in accordance with both the CPR and other 
legislation. The CE marking shows that the product complies with the requirements in 
all relevant EU legislation.  
* British Standards  
Nearly all British Standards for construction products are the British version of 
harmonised European Standards used for CE marking. The British Standards 
Institution (BSI) numbering policy is to adopt the European Committee for 
Standardisation (CEN) numbering, prefaced with BS e.g. BS EN 197- 1: 2000.  
Some British Standards are the British version of non- harmonised European 
standards; these also adopt the CEN numbering, prefaced with BS. These do not 
contain an Annex ZA, so CE marking cannot be affixed to products made to these 
standards.  
Some British Standards for products not covered by a European standard will continue 
to exist.  
Where a construction product has been made and assessed in accordance with one or 
more British Standards, this may show whether the product is suitable for its intended 
use. 
* Other national and international technical specifications  
An international technical specification, including those prepared by the International 
Organization for Standardization  (ISO), or on a national technical specification of a 
country other than the UK, may be used to demonstrate that a product not covered by 
a harmonised European sta ndard meets the performance requirements of the Building 
Regulations.  
Where necessary, the 'relevant person' who intends to carry out the work should 
obtain translations of specifications to demonstrate how the material meets the 
requirements of regulation 8. 
It should be noted that the national technical specifications of other EU Member States 
(and non- EU countries that are full members of CEN) are being progressively replaced 
by harmonised European standards, as is the case with British Standards.  
* Indepe ndent certification schemes  
There are many independent product certification schemes in the UK and elsewhere 
which may be a further source of information on product performance. Such schemes 
certify that a material complies with the requirements of a recog nised document and 
indicates it is suitable for its intended use. These may be in addition to, but not conflict 
with, CE marking. It should be noted that, materials which are not certified by an 
independent scheme may still conform to a relevant standard.  
Accreditation of a certification body by a national accreditation body belonging to the 
European co- operation on Accreditation (EA) provides a means of demonstrating that 
their certification scheme can be relied upon. In the UK, most independent certificat ion 
bodies are accredited by UK Accreditation Service (UKAS), which belongs to the EA.  
################# - Page 37 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 37 Applicable from 5  June 2023   It is important to check the scope of the accreditation of certification body, as 
accreditation may cover only part of the certification body's testing or certification 
business.  
* Tests and calculations 
Where there is no relevant harmonised European standard, tests, calculation or other 
means may be used to demonstrate that materials will be capable of performing the 
function for which they are intended. UKAS  or an equivalent national accreditation 
body belonging to the EA may accredit the testing laboratories. This accreditation 
provides a means of showing that such tests can be relied on.  
* Past experience  
Past experience, such as in buildings in use may show that materials can perform the 
function for which they are intended.  
0.8.6  Short lived materials  
Some materials, in the absence of special care, may be considered unsuitable because of 
their rapid deterioration in relation to the expected life of the building.  
Short -lived materials that are readily accessible for inspection, maintenance and 
replacement may meet the requirements of the regulations if the consequences of failure 
are not likely to be serious to the health or safety of persons in and around bui ldings.  
If short- lived materials are not readily accessible for inspection, maintenance and 
replacement, and the consequences of failure are likely to be serious for health or safety, it 
is unlikely that the material will meet the requirements of the regul ations.  
0.8.7  Materials susceptible to change in their properties  
The properties of some materials can change in certain environmental conditions. These 
changes can affect the performance of the materials over time.  
Materials that are susceptible to changes in their properties may be used in building work 
and will meet the requirements of the regulations if the residual properties, including the 
structural properties:  
* can be estimated at the time of their incorporation in the work, and  
* are shown to be suita ble for buildings to perform the function for which they are 
intended, for the expected life of the building.  
0.8.8  Ways of establishing the suitability of workmanship  
The term workmanship has been included so that references to methods of establishing 
workmanship can be included in the Technical Handbooks. For example, where 
performance depends on the construction being carried out with a crucial standard of 
workmanship, say in the construction of separating walls in a dwelling, it will prove useful 
to consider the information provided in British Standard BS 8000.  
It is not the intention that verifiers check workmanship generally, certainly not for purely 
aesthetic matters.  
################# - Page 38 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 38 Applicable from 5  June 2023   It may be useful to consider the following as ways of establishing t he suitability of 
workmanship:  
* CE marking  
For materials having a CE marking, workmanship may be specified in the relevant 
ETA or harmonised product standard.  
* Standards  
Methods of carrying out different types of work are also given in British Standards or 
other appropriate technical specifications. It should be noted that the BS 8000 series 
of standards on workmanship on building sites combines guidance from other BSI 
codes and standards. These are:  
* BS EN ISO 9000: 2005 -  Quality management systems. Fundamen tals and 
vocabulary.  
* BS EN ISO 9000: 2008 -  Quality management systems.  Requirements.

* Independent certification schemes  
Some independent certification schemes specify how workmanship will deliver a 
declared level of performance. The relevant person carrying out the work should show 
that the workmanship will provide the appropriate level of protection and performance.  
Schemes, including "Certification of design" and "Certification of constructions" that 
register installers of materials can provide a means of ensuring that work has been 
carried out by knowledgeable contractors to appropriate standards. See 0.8.9 
Certification.  
* Management systems 
The quality of workmanship is covered by a quality management scheme, such as one 
that complies with the relevant recommendations of BS EN ISO 9000, and related 
series of standards. There are a number of such UKAS accredited schemes.  
* Past experience  
Past experience, such as in a building in use, may show that the method of 
workmanship is capable of performing the function for which it is intended.  
* Tests 
Tests can be used to show that workmanship is appropriate for compliance with 
building regulations.  
Those carrying out building work may voluntarily include testing to demonstrate that 
the work complies with the requirements of the building regulations.  
Verifiers may request a 'materials test' under Section 41 (2) of the Building (Scotland) 
Act 2003 if they co nsider it necessary, to establish whether building work and 
materials comply with the requirements of regulations 8 and 9 of the Building 
(Scotland) Regulations 2004, as amended.  
0.8.9  Certification  
Scottish Ministers can, under Section 7 of the Building ( Scotland) Act 2003, approve 
schemes for the certification of design or construction for compliance with the mandatory 
functional standards. See 0.1.10 for works that can be Certified.

Page 40 Applicable from 5  June 2023   0.9 Building standards applicable to 
construction  
Regulation 9  
1. Subject  to paragraph (2), construction shall be carried out so that the 
work complies with the applicable requirements of schedule 5.  
2. Only the requirements of the standards set out in paragraphs 1.1, 3.17, 
3.18, 3.19, 3.20, 3.21, 3.22 and 4.4 of schedule 5 apply in the case of the 
construction of a building of a type described in paragraph 23A of 
schedule 3.  
 
 
0.9.1  Explanation 
Regulation 9 and schedule 5 are the heart of the building standards system as they set out 
what must be achieved in building work. The standards are given in full along with the 
associated guidance on compliance in sections 1 - 7 of the Technical Handbooks. 
Sections 1 -  7 relate directly to the basic works requirements, as published by the EC, 
which buildings and works are expected to satisf y when they have been properly designed 
and built.  
The seven sections are:  
* Section 1 Structure (EC - Mechanical resistance and stability)  
* Section 2 Fire (EC -  Safety in case of fire)  
* Section 3 Environment (EC -  Hygiene, health and the environment)  
* Sectio n 4 Safety (EC -  Safety and accessibility in use)  
* Section 5 Noise (EC -  Protection against noise)  
* Section 6 Energy (EC -  Energy, economy and heat retention)  
* Section 7 Sustainability  (EC - Sustainable use of natural resources)  
The basic work requirements are also subject to overall requirements related to durability, 
which are covered in regulation 8.  
The guidance on suitable provision to meet the building regulation standards is given 
without assurance that any other legislative or administrative requirement might apply 
more onerous standards.  
In considering which standards apply, where more than one is relevant to any building 
work all the standards should be met.  
0.9.2  Schedule  5 
The mandatory standards in schedule 5 are given in the seven s ections of this Handbook 
(Structure, Fire safety, Environment, Safety, Noise, Energy and Sustainability) and are 
therefore not repeated here.

Page 41 Applicable from 5  June 2023   0.10 Building standards applicable to demolition  
Regulation 10  
1. Every building to be demolished must be demolished in such a way 
that all service connections to the building are properly closed off 
and any neighbouring building is left stable and watertight.  
2. When demolition work has been completed, and where no further 
work is to commence immediately, the person who ca rried out that 
work shall ensure that the site is:  
a) immediately graded and cleared, or  
b) provided with such fences, protective barriers or hoardings as 
will prevent  access thereto.  
 
 
0.10.1   Explanation  
Regulation 10 sets out the mandatory requirements when u ndertaking demolition work.  
The building regulations do not control the method or process of demolition. This is the 
responsibility of the Health and Safety Executive and is covered under other  legislation.  
What the building regulations do seek to control is the area which is left after demolition 
has been completed, and the state of any surrounding buildings affected by the demolition. 
Any adjacent buildings must be left safe and watertight and all service connections must 
be properly sealed. Unless it is intended to build on the cleared site without delay, it must 
be left in a safe condition. This might be achieved by site clearance and grading, or by 
ensuring adequate perimeter enclosures.

Page 43 Applicable from 5  June 2023   0.12 Building standards applicable to conversions  
Regulation 12  
Conversions shall be carried out so that the building as converted complies with 
the applicable requirements of schedule 6.  
 
 
0.12.1  Explanation 
Certain changes of use or occupation were defined as conversions in schedule 2 and are 
therefore s ubject to the building regulations. Regulation 12 requires that in these cases the 
building shall meet the requirements of schedule 6. However it is recognised that this is 
not reasonably practicable in many existing buildings. Therefore the schedule also lists 
those standards where a lower level of provision may well be sufficient. It is essential to 
establish with the verifier where meeting the standards in full is not reasonably practicable, 
and early discussion will be necessary. The individual sections  of the Handbooks give 
further details.  
For historic buildings, the classification of the building should influence the extent to which 
improvement is required, depending on whether the classification is for the outside, the 
inside, all parts, etc.  
0.12.2  Schedule  6 
Every conversion, to which these regulations apply, shall meet the requirements of the 
following standards in schedule 5:  
a. Standards 2.1, 2.3, 2.5, 2.9, 2.10, 2.11, 2.13, 2.14, 2.15 in Section 2, Fire 
b. Standards 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.11, 3.12 , 3.13, 3.14, 3.17, 3.18, 3.20, 3.21, 3.22, 
3.23, 3.24, 3.25, 3.26, 3.27 in Section 3, Environment  
c. Standards 4.5, 4.6, 4.7, 4.9, 4.11, 4.12, 4.13 in Section 4, Safety  
d. Standards 5.1 and 5.2 in Section 5, Noise, and 
e. Standards 6.7, 6.8, 6.10 in Section 6, Energy.  
Every conversion, to which these regulations apply, shall meet the requirements of the 
following standards in schedule 5 in so far as is reasonably practicable, and in no case be 
worse than before the conversion:  
a. the standards in Section 1, Structure  
b. Standards 2.2, 2.4, 2.6, 2.7, 2.8, 2.12 in Section 2, Fire  
c. Standards 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.10, 3.15, 3.16, 3.19, 3.28 in Section 3, Environment  
d. Standards 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.8, 4.10 in Section 4, Safety, and  
e. Standards 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6 in Section 6, Energy.  
Note: Standard 7.1 (Sustainability) does not apply to conversions.

Page 44 Applicable from 5  June 2023   Every conversion, to which these regulations apply, which--  
a. alters the number dwellings, or the number of building units, in the building,  
b. changes the occupation or use of -- 
i. a residential building to any other type of building, or  
ii. a building so that it becomes a residential building,  
must meet the requirements of standard 7.2.   
In this respect, "building unit" means a part of a building which is designed or altered to be 
used separately.

Regulation 13  
1. No person shall carry out work unless the following provisions of this 
regulation are complied with.  
2. Subject to paragraph (3), where work is to be carried out on any 
building site or building which is within 3.6  m of any part of a road or 
other place to which members of the public have access (whether or 
not on payment of a fee or charge) there shall, prior to commencement 
of the work, be erected protective works so as to separate the building 
site or building or that part of the building site or building on which 
work is to be carried out from that road or other place.  
3. Nothing in paragraph (2) shall require the provision of  protective works 
in any case where the local authority is satisfied that no danger to the 
public is caused, or is likely to be caused, by the work.  
4. The protective works referred to in the preceding paragraphs are all or 
any of:  
a) providing hoardings, barrie rs or fences  
b) subject to paragraph (5), where necessary to prevent danger, 
providing footpaths outside such hoardings, barriers or fences with 
safe and convenient platforms, handrails, steps or ramps, and 
substantial overhead coverings  
c) any other protective works which in the opinion of the local 
authority are necessary to ensure the safety of the public, all of 
such description, material and dimensions and in such position as 
the local authority may direct.  
5. Nothing in paragraph (4)(b) shall require the provi sion of a platform, 
handrail, step or ramp:  
a) where no part of the existing footpath is occupied by the protective 
works or in connection with the work, or  
b) where that part of an existing footpath remaining unoccupied 
affords a safe means of passage for peopl e, and is of a width of not 
less than 1.2 m or such greater width as the local authority may 
direct.  
6. Any protective works shall be so erected as to cause no danger to the 
public and shall be maintained to the satisfaction of the local authority.  
7. Subject to paragraph (8), any protective works shall be removed:  
a) in the case of a building which has been constructed by virtue of a 
warrant, not more than 14 days or such longer period as the local

project on to or over that part of a road which is not a pavement or 
footp ath shall be provided with such markings, as in the opinion of the 
local authority are necessary to secure the safety of the public.  
10. Where work has been carried out without the provision of protective 
works, or where work on a building site has stopped or a building site 
has been abandoned, a local authority may require the site owner to 
carry out protective works.  
 
 
0.13.1  Explanation 
Regulation 13 requires that building sites are fenced off in such a way as to protect the 
public. It also provides powers to deal with building sites where work has for any reason 
ceased and the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act provisions are no longer applicable.

Page 50 Applicable from 5  June 2023   0.17 Continuing  Requirements  
Regulation 17  
1. Subject to paragraph (2), the owners of buildings shall ensure that:  
a) every air -conditioning system within a building is inspected at 
regular intervals, and  
b) following each inspection of that system the owner of the 
building or, where the owner is not the occupier, the occupier is 
given a report containing the result of the inspection and 
including recommendations for the cost -effective improvement of 
the energy performance of that system.  
2. This regulation shall not apply to: 
a) air-conditioning systems with a total effective output rating of 
less than 12kW, or  
b) air-conditioning systems solely for processes within a building.  
3. In terms of section 2 of the Building (Scotland) Act 2003 the 
provisions of paragraph (1) are a designa ted provision in respect of 
which there is a continuing requirement imposed on the owners of 
buildings.  
 
 
0.17.1  Explanation 
Regulation 17 requires the owners of an air -conditioned building to have such plant 
regularly inspected and to provide advice to the users of the building on related energy 
efficiency improvement work and how to operate the system efficiently. This regulation 
implements the terms of Articles 15 & 16 of Directive 2010/31/EU on the Energy 
Performance of Buildings (EPBD).  
Scope - the regulation relates only to larger, fixed air -conditioning systems and does not 
cover portable systems. It also relates to comfort cooling of people in a building but does 
not cover any other system, such as cooling solely used in a manufacturing, trade or 
mechanical process. For example, a system only cooling computer equipment would be 
exempt.  
The efficiency of the system should be assessed and the sizing compared to the cooling 
requirements of the building and appropriate advice given to the users of the bui lding on 
possible improvement or replacement of the system and on alternative solutions.  
0.17.2  Implementation 
Continuing requirement -  the regulation imposes a continuing requirement that means 
inspections are required not only throughout the life of a new building, but also for the life 
of an existing building, for as long as it has an air -conditioning system. The requirement to 
inspec t systems in existing buildings was introduced in stages, starting with first inspection 
################# - Page 51 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 51 Applicable from 5  June 2023   of larger systems over 250 kW by 4 January 2011, followed by first inspection of all 
remaining systems over 12 kW by 4 January 2013.  
0.17.3  Procedures to be  followed 
CIBSE Technical Memorandum 44 (TM44) 'Inspection of air conditioning systems' 
provides guidance on the regular inspection and assessment of air -conditioning systems 
and on the provision of advice and alternative solutions.  
Inspection frequency -  for complet ely new air -conditioning systems, one way of meeting 
paragraph 1(a) of this regulation would be to make arrangements at completion for the first 
inspection. This should be carried out by an accredited expert no later than 5 years after 
the acceptance of th e completion of commissioning of the system to Standard 6.7.  
For existing systems over 12kW, one way of meeting paragraph 1(a) of this regulation 
would be to make arrangements for an inspection to be carried out by an accredited 
expert.  
In all cases, the accredited expert doing the inspection has the discretion to set the 
frequency of inspections ranging from three years for poorly maintained and inefficient 
systems up to five years for those systems that are well maintained and demonstrate 
excellent levels  of efficiency. In order to ensure compliance with the continuing 
requirement, the subsequent inspection should be carried out within the intervening time 
period.  
The following issues should be considered in setting an inspection of systems more 
frequently  than five years:  
a. inefficiency of system  
b. significantly oversized in relation to the cooling requirements  
c. evidence that the design is not fit for purpose  
d. evidence of poor installation  
e. evidence of lack of maintenance  
f. control system out of adjustment  
g. age of s ystem.  
Size of systems -  a number of individual systems each 12kW or less, but taken together 
totalling more than 12 kW, within one building or fire- separated part of a building, would 
only qualify for inspection if they are linked by way of a central cont rol. 
New buildings -  for new buildings, commissioning of building services including air - 
conditioning systems and the provision of written information shall be in accordance with 
Standards 6.7 and 6.8 respectively and guidance to these standards is provided in the 
Domestic and Non- domestic Technical Handbooks.  
Accredited experts - inspections of existing air -conditioning systems should be carried 
out by accredited experts who are members of protocol organisations who are approved by 
Scottish Government to carry out such inspections.  
Information on current protocol organisations can be found on the Building Standards 
Division web pages at www.scotland.gov.uk/epc  
################# - Page 52 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 52 Applicable from 5  June 2023   0.17.4  Provision of information to owners and occupiers  
Following inspection of a system, the inspection report shall be issued by the member of 
the protocol organisation to the owner of the building. The inspection report shall contain 
the result of the inspection and include recommendations for the cost -effective 
improvement of the energy performance of the inspected system.  
Where the owner of the building is not also the occupier, the owner should provide a copy 
of the report to the occupier.  
0.17.5  Other legislative  requirements  
This guidance relates solely to duties imposed under Articles 15 & 16 of the Directive 
2010/31/EU  on the Energy Performance of buildings. There ar e other separate legislative 
requirements for the inspection of air conditioning systems such as the F -Gas Regulations 
which are not dealt with in building regulations. However from an operational point of view, 
building owners should give consideration to the economic benefits of combining such 
inspections where appropriate.

################# - Page 54 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 54 Applicable from 5  June 2023   Section 1 -  Structure 
1.0 Introduction  
1.0.1  Background 
The structure of a building is fundamental to ensuring the safety of people in or around 
new and existing buildings and can be affected by a number of factors inside and outside 
the building including environmental factors. These factors should be considered to 
prevent the collapse, excessive deformation or the disproportionate collapse of buildings.  
The climatic conditions in Scotland including temperature, snow, wind, driving rain and 
flooding and the impact of climate change should be carefully considered in the 
assessment of loadings (actions) and in the structural design of buildings.  
The Standing Committee on Structural Safety (SCOSS) is an independent body 
supported by the Institution of Civil Engineers, the Institution of Structural Engineers and 
the Health and Safety Executive to maintain a continuing review of building and civil 
engineering matters affecting the safety of structures. The prime function of SCOSS is to 
identify in advance those trends and developments that might contribute to an increasing 
risk to structural safety. The collation and dissemination of information relating to matters 
of structural concern is a vital element of achieving safe structures. SCOSS has 
established a UK wide confidential reporting system (CROSS) to gather data on structural 
problems.  
Appraisal of existing buildings - conversions to existing buildings present particular 
problems and an appraisal of the existing structure for its new occupation or use should be 
undertaken to ensure that appropriate measures are taken to meet the requirements of 
regulation 12. Guidance on how a structural appraisal may be undertaken is given in 
'Appraisal of Existing Structures', 1996 published by the Institution of Structural Engineers.  
Procurement - the contractual arrangements used by clients to procure a building can 
have important consequences for the reliability of the design and the adequacy of the 
construction. Frequently, building design procurement will involve the appointment of a 
number of designers who may be employed by more than one organisation. Detailed 
design of individual structural details and components can be passed to specialist 
contractors. In these circumstances the client should appoint a lead designer or other 
appropriately experienced and qualified person to oversee the design process.  
1.0.2  Aims  
The intention of this section is to ensure that the structure of a building shall be designed 
and executed in such a way that, during its intended life, it will not pose a threat to the 
safety of people in and around the building with an appropriate degree of reliability. To 
achieve a structure with adequat e structural resistance, serviceability and durability the 
following should be taken into account:  
a. the loadings (actions) on the  building  
b. nature of the ground  
c. collapse or deformations  
################# - Page 55 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 55 Applicable from 5  June 2023   d. stability  of the building and other  buildings  
e. climatic conditions  
f. materi als 
g. structural analysis, and  
h. details of construction.  
The actions on the building will comprise a set of loads applied directly to the structure that 
will include dynamic, concentrated and peak load effects, together with a set of imposed 
deformations caus ed for example by temperature changes or uneven settlement.  
1.0.3  Latest  changes  
The following is a summary of the changes made to this section since 1 May 2009.  
* 1.0.1 reference to SCOSS updated  
* guidance for clients on procurement added  
* aims re-written to reflect Structural Eurocodes  
* guidance on relevant legislation added for CDM regulations  
* guidance on alternative approaches added including the use of withdrawn British 
Standards  
* 1.0.7 clause on certification introduced  
* reference to guidance on fixings and stone masonry added  
* reference to Structural Eurocodes added for loadings  
* reference to Structural Eurocodes added for design and  construction  
* reference to BS EN 1997- 2:2007 added for geotechnical investigation of the site 
* reference to BS EN 19 97-1:2004 added for design of foundations adjacent to existing

* 1.A. Annex A - list of structural Eurocodes and corresponding British Standards  to be 
withdrawn added.  
The previous annexes forming the Small Buildings Structural Guidance (SBSG) have been 
removed from the Technical Handbook and are now referenced in clause 1.0.5.  
Minor alterations and corrections have also been made. A full list of changes to this edition 
of the Technical Handbooks is available on the Building Standards website.  
1.0.4  Relevant  legislation 
The Construction (Design and Management) Regulations 2007 are intended to protect 
people working in construction and others who may be affected by their activities. The 
regulations require the systematic management of projects from concept to completion 
and throughout the life cycle of the structure, including eventual demolition. Clients have a 
duty to ensure that competent people are employed to do the work, that sufficient time is 
################# - Page 56 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 56 Applicable from 5  June 2023   allocated for the work to be undertaken and that the various members of the design and 
construction teams co -operate and exchange information.  
1.0.5  Alternative  approaches  
Where alternative approaches to the structural design are proposed other than using the 
guidance contained in this section, the structural design should take account of all of the 
factors identified in clause 1.0.2 above. For example, care should be taken where 
alternative numerical values are placed on factors of safety as this may have a detrimental 
effect on the overall stability of the structure.  
The British Standards Institution (BSI) agreement with the European Committee for 
Standardisation (CEN) obliges it to withdraw UK national s tandards after a harmonised 
European Standard with the same scope and field of application has been produced. 
Withdrawal of a standard implies that while documents will still be available there will be no 
support or five- year review by a BSI committee to c onsider the currency of the standard 
and to decide whether it should be confirmed, revised or withdrawn. BSI, in line with this 
commitment, will be 31 March 2010 replace the British Standards relating to loading and 
structural design with the European Standards and associated National Annexes listed in 
Sections 1.1.2 and 1.1.3 of this guidance.  
Whilst other guidance documents or international standards, including withdrawn national 
standards might be used in alternative approaches to satisfy building regulations, 
designers, verifiers, or in the case of certified projects, the approved certifiers of design 
(building structures) will need to satisfy themselves that the use of such guidance is 
appropriate for a specific project. Care should be exercised, partic ularly with withdrawn 
standards, in relation to wind and snow loadings (actions) where the effects of climate 
change may render these unsafe.  
Where alternative approaches use design methods or codes other than those listed in this 
guidance then these must be used within the context of the assumptions set out in Section 
1.1.3. Designs must be checked in order to deliver similar levels of design reliability.  
The Small Buildings Structural Guidance (SBSG) provides structural guidance to 
designers of small domestic buildings on how to comply with Standard 1.1. The guidance 
was published in Section 1 (Annexes 1.A to 1.F) of the Technical Handbooks in May 2005 
(updated in 2007) and based on British Standards which have now been withdrawn.  
The SBSG, together with r esearch on the impact of the Structural Eurocodes on masonry 
construction, is available on the Building Standards Division website . The SBSG has been 
written for those with expertise in building design and construction but not necessarily in 
structural engineering design. Where the conditions or parameters fall outside the scope of 
the guidance, then specialist advice should be sought from approved certifiers of design, 
chartered engineers or other appropriately qualified persons.

Scottish Ministers can, under Section 7 of the Building (Scotland) Act 2003, approve 
schemes for the certification of design or construction for compliance with the mandatory 
functional standards. Such schemes are approved on the basis that the procedures 
adopted by the scheme will take account of the need to co- ordinate the work of various 
designers and specialist contractors. Individuals approved to provide certification services 
under the scheme are assessed to ensure that they have the qualifications, skills and 
experience required to certify compliance for the work covered by the scope of the 
scheme. Checking procedures adopted by Approved Certifiers will deliver design or 
installation reliability in accordance with legislation.  
The Certification of Design (Building Structures) scheme has been approved by Scottish 
Ministers to confirm compliance with Standards 1.1 and 1.2. Details are available on the 
Building Standards Division website .

Page 58 Applicable from 5  June 2023   1.1 Structure  
Mandatory  Standard  
Standard 1.1  
Every building must be designed and constructed in such a way that the 
loadings that are liable to act on it, taking into account the nature of the ground, 
will not lead to:  
a) the collapse of the whole or part of the building 
b) deformations which would make the building unfit for its intended use, 
unsafe, or cause damage to other parts of the building or to fittings or 
to installed equipment, or  
c) impairment of the stability of any part of another building.  
 
 
1.1.0  Introduction 
The loadings on the building will comprise actions that may be applied both separately and 
in various combinations.  
The stability of a buildi ng and other existing buildings in the vicinity can be affected by 
ground conditions which should be investigated and assessed to ensure that the ground 
can safely support the building.  
The collapse of the whole or part of a building is clearly a matter of  the highest importance 
with respect to public safety. The design and construction of buildings should take into 
account all contributing factors such as loadings, climatic conditions, partial safety factors 
for materials and loadings, and design methodology to ensure that there is an acceptable 
probability that the building will not collapse (ultimate limit state) during its design lifetime.  
Similarly deformations of buildings while not leading to an ultimate collapse can lead to 
public safety concerns par ticularly where they become unfit or unsafe for use. This can 
become apparent in several ways ranging from cracking, movement or springiness of 
floors, doors or windows not opening or closing, damage to pipes and other services within 
the building. The des ign and construction of a building should ensure that, by taking into 
account the factors set out above, the building does not fail in normal use (serviceability 
limit state).  
The stability of existing buildings  can be affected if the design and constructi on of a new 
building does not take into account any potential impacts on existing buildings. This could 
lead to a risk of collapse or damage to existing buildings with a consequent risk to public 
safety.  
Conversions - in the case of conversions, as specifi ed in regulation 4, the building as 
converted shall meet the requirements of this standard in so far as is reasonably 
practicable, and in no case be worse than before the conversion (regulation 12, schedule 
6).

Page 59 Applicable from 5  June 2023   1.1.1  General  
In order to be safe, a building should be capable of resisting all loads acting on it as a 
result of its intended use and geographical location. To achieve this, the structure of a 
building should be designed with margins of safety to ensure that the mandatory functional 
standar d has been met.  
In clause (b) of Standard 1.1 deformations are not intended to cover aesthetic damage 
such as shrinkage and other minor cracking.  
Specialist advice from approved certifiers of design, chartered engineers or other 
appropriately qualified per sons should be sought if the designer is in any doubt about the 
loads acting on a building or how these loads can be accommodated by the structure and 
safely transmitted to the ground.  
Fixings - the SCOSS committee has expressed concern that safety critical fixings do not 
always receive the attention that they deserve. Fixings are important structural 
components. Designers must be satisfied that fixings receive the same consideration as 
other aspects of the design in terms of their selection, design, instal lation, inspection and 
testing. A SCOSS ALERT "The Selection and Installation of Construction Fixings" has 
been issued and can be found on the new CROSS website . 
Stone Masonry  - the Scottish Stone Liaison Group publication ' Natural stone masonry in 
modern Scottish construction: guidance ' provides guidance in the use of natural stone in 
new construction. Guidance includes information on stone and mortar selection, soiling of 
facades and design details for structures and moisture control.  
1.1.2  Loading 
Any reference to European Standards for Structure (Structural Eurocodes) in this section 
must be taken to include reference to the relevant UK National Annex.  
The loadings to which a building will be subjected should be calculated in accordance with 
the appropriate Structural Euroc odes:  
a. for densities, self -weight and imposed loadings, BS EN 1991- 1-1: 2002 (Eurocode 1) 
b. for snow loadings, BS EN 1991- 1-3:2003 (Eurocode 1)  
c. for wind loadings, BS EN 1991- 1-4:2005 (Eurocode  1) 
d. for earth retaining structures, BS EN 1997- 1:2004 (Eurocode 7)  
e. any greater loadings to which the building is likely to be subjected.  
1.1.3  Design and construction 
Any reference to European Standards for Structure (Structural Eurocodes) in this section 
must be taken to include reference to the relevant UK National Annex.  
The structural design and construction of a building should be carried out in accordance 
with the following Structural Eurocodes:  
a. for foundations, BS EN 1997- 1:2004 (Eurocode 7) 
b. for structural work of reinforced, pre- stressed or plain concrete, BS EN 1992- 1-1:2004

i. for earth retaining structures BS EN 1997- 1:2004 (Eurocode 7).  
The reliability of designs carried out in accordance with these codes is based on a number 
of assumptions set out in BS EN 1990:2002 that include:  
* the choice of the structural system and the design of the structure is made by 
appropriately qualified and experienced personnel  
* the design and construction is carried out by personnel having the appropriate skill and 
experience  
* adequate supervision and quality control is provided during execution of the work  
* the construction material s and products are used as specified in BS EN 1990 or in BS 
EN 1991 to BS EN 1999 or in the relevant execution standards, or reference material 
or product specifications  
* the structure will be adequately maintained, and  
* the structure will be used in accordance with the design assumptions.  
Those responsible for procuring the design and construction of buildings based on 
Structural Eurocodes should be aware of these assumptions and should ensure that they 
have employed individuals with the necessary qualificat ions, skills and experience and that 
appropriate procedures for checking designs have been adopted.  
1.1.4  Nature of the  ground 
The foundations of buildings should be designed to sustain and transmit the loadings to 
the ground in such a manner that there wi ll be no ground movement which will impair the 
stability of the building. All aspects of the nature of the ground should be taken into 
consideration including ground movement caused by:  
* swelling, shrinkage or freezing of the subsoil, or  
* landslip, or  
* subsid ence such as that arising from the collapse of abandoned mineral workings or 
quarrying operations.  
There may be known or recorded conditions of ground instability, such as that arising from 
landslides, disused mines or unstable strata which, if ignored, co uld have an adverse 
################# - Page 61 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 61 Applicable from 5  June 2023   effect on a building. Such conditions should be taken into account in the design and 
construction of the building and its foundations.  
Attention is drawn to Planning Policy Guidance Note 14 (PPG 14) Development on 
unstable land . Although PPG 14 contains specific reference to England & Wales, it does 
set out the broad planning and technical issues relating to development on unstable land.  
Information on the scale and nature of problems arising from mining instability, natural 
underground cavities and adverse foundation conditions is available from the following:  
* British Geological Survey, Murchison House, West M ains Road, Edinburgh, EH9 3LA 
http://www.bgs.ac.uk .  
* The Coal Authority, 200 Lichfield Lane, Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, NG18 4RG Coal 
Authority - GOV.UK (www.gov.uk)  
Information can also be obtained from local authorities that hold Building Standards 
Registers and other relevant records.  
Where new foundations are to be constructed or existing foundations altered it will 
generally be necessary to undertake a geotechnical investigation of the site. T his should 
be carried out using the methods described in BS EN 1997- 2: 2007.  
1.1.5  Stability of existing  buildings  
The stability of existing buildings may be affected by a new building located in their vicinity. 
Care must be taken to avoid undermining the foundations or otherwise affect the stability 
of existing buildings. The design of foundations adjacent to existing buildings should be 
carried out in accordance with the recommendations of BS EN 1997 -1:2004.  
Factors that can also affect the stability of an existing building and should be taken into 
account include:  
* additional or new loads arising from the construction of the new building  
* increased or new wind loads arising from the construction of the new building  
* pressure bulb extending below existing building  
* changes in groundwater level  
* loss of fines during pumping operations or climatic conditions.

Page 62 Applicable from 5  June 2023   1.2 Disproportionate  Collapse  
Mandatory Standard  
Standard 1.2  
Every building must be designed and constructed in such a way that in the 
event of damage occurring to any part of the structure of the building the extent 
of any resultant collapse will not be disproportionate to the original cause.  
 
 
1.2.0  Introduction 
All buildings must be designed to accommodate unforeseen or accidental actions in such a 
way as to prevent the extent of any resulting collapse being disproportionate to the cause 
of the collapse. Buildings should be designed so that they are robust which is defined in 
BS EN -1991- 1-7:2006 as the ability of a structure to withstand events like fire, explosions, 
impact or the consequences of human error without being damaged to an extent 
disproportionate to the original cause.  
Explanation of terms  
Nominal length of load- bearing wall construction should be taken as:  
* in the case of a reinforced concrete wall, the distance between lateral supports subject 
to a length not more than 2.25 x storey  height  
* in the case of an external masonry wall, or timber or steel stud wall, the length 
measured between vertical lateral supports  
* in the case of  an internal masonry wall, or timber or steel stud wall, a length not more 
than 2.25 x storey  height.  
Storey height is the distance from the underside of one floor to the underside of the floor 
immediately above.  
Key element is a structural member upon which the stability of the remainder of the 
structure depends and should be capable of sustaining an accidental design loading of      
34 kN/m2 applied in the horizontal and vertical directions (in one direction at a time) to the 
member and any attached components such as cladding, having regard to the ultimate 
strength of such components and their connections. Such accidental design loading 
should be assumed to act simultaneously with 1/3rd of all normal characteristic loading.  
Load bearing wall constructi on includes masonry cross -wall construction and walls 
comprising close centred timber or lightweight steel section studs.  
Fire - the protection to be afforded to the structure of a building when it is exposed to the 
action of fire is dealt with by mandator y Standard 2.3. The guidance within Section 2 refers 
to relevant codes that should be used for the design of the structure in a fire.  
Conversions - in the case of conversions, as specified in regulation 4, the building as 
converted shall meet the requirements of this standard in so far as is reasonably  
################# - Page 63 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 63 Applicable from 5  June 2023   practicable, and in no case be worse than before the conversion (regulation 12, schedule 
6). 
1.2.1  Disproportionate  collapse  
A building which is susceptible to disproportionate collapse is one where the effec ts of 
accidents and, in particular, situations where damage to small areas of a structure or 
failure of single elements could lead to collapse of major parts of the structure.  
Buildings should be provided with a level of robustness by adopting the principl es of risk 
analysis, categorising buildings, taking into account both the risk of the hazard and its 
consequences and providing additional measures commensurate to the level of risk and 
consequences of such collapse of the building. The risk level and acci dental actions that 
should be considered when undertaking the structural design of a building for 
disproportionate collapse should be in accordance with the recommendations of BS EN 
1991- 1-7:2006 or the method set out below.  
Any reference to European Stand ards for Structure (Structural Eurocodes) in this section 
must be taken to include the relevant UK National Annex.  
To ensure that buildings are designed and constructed to sustain a limited extent of 
damage or failure without a disproportionate level of collapse from an unspecified cause, 
the following procedure should be followed:  
* determine building risk group  
* assess additional measures  
* design and construct additional measures.  
1.2.2  Determine building risk  group 
The issues to be considered with respect to assessing the risk group of a building are its 
occupancy level, use, the number of storeys and floor areas.  
The risk of an extreme event such as an explosion or other incident occurring would not be 
decreased simply by providing these measures and there is no certainty that  
demolition or building alteration would be carried out in accordance with good practice but 
the consequences of such an incident occurring would be considerably reduced.  
Table  1.1 Determine building risk group 
 
Risk Group  Building Type  
1 Houses not more than 4 storeys  
Carports, Conservatories and Greenhouses  
Domestic garages and other small single leaf buildings not more than 1 storey  
2A 5 storey houses  
Flats and maisonettes not more than 4 storeys  
2B Flats and maisonettes more than 4 storeys but not more than 15 storeys  
3 Every domestic building not covered in Risk Groups 1, 2A and 2B  
################# - Page 64 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 64 Applicable from 5  June 2023   The nomenclature of the Risk Groups 1, 2A, 2B and 3 are synonymous with the 
consequence classes in Table A.1 -  Categorisation of consequence classes of BS EN 
1991- 1-7:2006.  
In determining the number of storeys in a building, basement storeys may be excluded 
provided such basement storeys fulfil the robustness of Risk Group 2B buildings.  
For buildings intended for m ore than one type of use the Risk Group should be that 
pertaining to the most onerous Risk Group.  
1.2.3  Assess additional  measures  
The additional measures which should be provided vary extensively according to building 
type and use and the actual measures should be designed in accordance with the relevant 
sections of the design codes. For example, high rise hotels or flats or assembly buildings 
or grandstands require a different level of robustness than low rise buildings or storage 
buildings.  
The additional measures which should be applied to buildings of the risk groups derived 
from the above table are set out below:  
Risk Group 1 buildings -  no additional measures are likely to be necessary when the 
building has been designed and constructed in accordance with the rules given in this 
Technical Handbook, or other guidance referenced under Section 1, for complying with 
Standard 1.1 in normal use.  
Risk Group 2A buildings -  provide effective horizontal ties, or effective anchorage of 
suspended floors to walls, for framed and load -bearing wall construction.  
Risk Group 2B buildings -  provide effective horizontal ties for framed and load- bearing 
wall construction, together with effective vertical ties, in all supporting columns and walls.  
Alternatively, check that upon the notional removal of each supporting column and each 
beam supporting one or more columns, or any nominal length of load -bearing wall (one at 
a time in each storey of the building) the building should remain stable and that the area of 
floor at any storey at risk of collapse should be not more than 15% of the floor area  of that 
storey or 100 m2, whichever is the less and does not extend further than the immediate 
adjacent storeys (see diagram below).  
Where the notional removal of such columns and lengths of walls would result in an extent 
of damage in excess of the above limit, then such elements should be designed as 'key 
elements'.  
Risk Group 3 buildings -  a systematic risk assessment of the building should be carried 
out, taking into account all  the normal hazards that can be foreseen as far as possible 
together with any abnormal hazards.  
Critical situations for design should be selected that reflect the conditions that can be 
foreseen as far as possible during the life of the building.  
The struc tural form and concept and any protective measures should then be chosen and 
the detailed design of the structure and its elements undertaken in accordance with the 
recommendations in the codes and standards in clause 1.2.4.

1.2.4  Design and construct additional  measures  
The structural design and construction to take account of the additional measures 
including horizontal and vertical ties where appropriate and checking the integrity of the 
building following the notional  removal of vertical members and the design of key 
elements, should be carried out in accordance with the design recommendations 
contained in Annex A of BS EN 1991- 1-7:2006.  
1.2.5  Other sources of  guidance  
More detailed information has been produced by organisations on disproportionate 
collapse as follows:

Wales Requirement A3 -  Disproportionate Collapse', National House Building Council 
(NHBC)

Construction Institute  
e. 'How to design concrete buildings to satisfy disproportionate collapse requirements' 
http://www.concretecentre.com/   
The above guidance is based on England & Wales Regulation A3 and should be 
interpreted in relation to Standard 1.2. In particular, references to building classes should 
be risk groups and the building types and occupancy should be interpreted as the building 
types set out in the table to clause 1.2.2.

Page 72 Applicable from 5  June 2023   Section 2 -  Fire 
2.0 Introdu ction 
2.0.1  Background 
Life safety is the paramount objective of fire safety. Domestic buildings should be designed 
and constructed in such a way that the risk of fire is reduced and, if a fire does occur, there 
are measures in place to restrict the growth of fire and smoke to enable the occupants to 
escape safely and fire- fighters to deal with fire safely and effectively.  
There are almost 5000 reported fires in dwellings (e.g. houses, flats and maisonettes) 
every year in Scotland. Fires can have a devastating effect on the lives of people and 
results in around 40 deaths and 900 injuries each year. The most common cause of 
accidental fires in dwellings involved cooking appliances (62%), electrical supply or 
electrical lighting (14%), combustibles ignit ed due to being too close to candles or other 
heat source (9%), the remaining 15% is accounted for by the careless disposal of 
cigarettes  and matches and other domestic appliances. Evidence also shows that the 
consumption of alcohol and/or smoking are contributory factors which increases the risk of 
an accidental fire occurring. Occupants who are alone at the time of the fire and are in the 
room of fire origin, are more likely to suffer injury (e.g. burns and smoke inhalation) or even 
death in some cases.  
It is impossible to eliminate the risks from fire altogether and the prevention of deliberate or 
accidental fires caused by the actions of  occupants within a dwelling are outside the scope 
of building standards. For advice on best practice relating to fire safety in the home, visit 
the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service website  or contact the community fire safety team at 
your local fire station. Although beyond the scope of this guidance, the adoption of good 
fire safety practices should be encouraged to reduce the risk of fire occurring in the first 
place. Fire prevention will not only save lives but will protect property and reduce 
environmental pollution.  
The standards and guidance in this section are designed to work together to provide a 
balanced approach to fire safety. The building elements, materials, comp onents or other 
parts of the building identified in the guidance should follow the appropriate performance 
levels that are recommended throughout the guidance. However where an element, 
material, component, or other part of a building is covered by more than one standard, the 
more demanding guidance should be followed in most cases.  
2.0.2  Aims  
The purpose of the guidance in Section 2 is to achieve the following objectives in the case 
of an outbreak of fire within the building:  
* to protect life  
* to assist the fire and rescue services, and  
* to further the achievement of sustainable development.  
Protection of life -  it is important to recognise that the standards will not guarantee the life 
safety of all building occupants. Occupants in dwellings do not normally perceive 
################# - Page 73 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 73 Applicable from 5  June 2023   themselves to be at risk from fire and are not usually aware of the speed that fire can 
spread. The risk to occupants is greater if they are asleep during the outbreak of fire as 
they are likely to be roused more slowly. Occupants should be warned as soon as possible 
following the outbreak of fire and the guidance to Standard 2.11 provides 
recommendations for the installation of alarm and detection systems in domestic buildings.  
Fire and rescue service -  in some cases, occupants will not react quick ly enough before 
being overcome by the effects of the fire and smoke and as a result, may require to be 
rescued by the fire and rescue service. For facilities to assist the fire and rescue service, 
see Standards 2.12 to 2.14.  
Sustainability - the building regulations are primarily concerned with the protection of 
people from the dangers inherent in buildings, rather than protecting the owners of 
buildings from any economic loss which might occur. However following the guidance in 
the handbook will continue to embed active and passive fire protection systems within 
buildings which should reduce the likelihood of the total destruction of the building 
following the outbreak of fire.  
2.0.3 Scope  
Guidance in this section may not be appropriate for the following b uildings as they are 
rarely designed and constructed in Scotland:  
a. dwellings having an individual storey with an area more than 200 m2 
b. houses with a storey at a height of more than 18 m above ground level 
c. domestic buildings containing a basement storey at a  depth of more than 4.5 m below 
ground level  
d. domestic buildings with a communal room with an area more than 60 m2 
e. domestic buildings containing catwalks, openwork floors or  escalators  
f. domestic buildings containing places of special fire risk 
g. domestic buildings having an escape route over a flat roof or access deck,  or 
h. domestic buildings with a storey at a height of more than 60 m above ground level.  
For the purposes of (a) above, the area of an individual storey includes the area of a 
gallery or sleeping deck but excludes the area of an integral domestic garage.  
In the case of a mixed use building containing non- domestic and domestic 
accommodation, reference should be made to the Technical Handbook for non- domestic 
buildings as well as the guidance contained in this Handbook.  
In the case of sub- clauses (a) to (h) above, the alternative approach described in clause 
2.0.7 should be used.  
2.0.4  Method of  measurement  
The rules of measurement in Section 0 of the Technical Handbook may not be appropriate 
for the guidance in Section 2 Fire. For example, to establish the height of the topmost 
storey for fire and rescue service facilities, the height should be measured from the fire 
and rescue service access level and not necessarily the lowest ground level. T herefore, 
################# - Page 74 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 74 Applicable from 5  June 2023   methods of measurement unique to fire are described within the guidance under each of 
the relevant standards.  
Plant Storeys -  for the purpose of measurement, the height above ground to the top most 
storey excludes, roof -top plant areas and any top storeys consisting exclusively of plant 
rooms.  
2.0.5  Latest  changes

2.0.6  Explanation of  terms 
Flat or maisonette -  for the purposes of the guidance in  Section 2 Fire, except in relation 
to the guidance to Standard 2.15, a flat or maisonette entered only from the open air at 
ground level and with no storey at a height of more than 4.5m should be regarded as a 
house and follow the guidance accordingly.  
Protected routes of escape -  throughout the document there are references to protected 
routes of escape these include: open access balconies, galleries wholly or partly enclosed 
below, protected lobbies, protected zones, protected enclosures, external escape stairs, 
basements and alternative exits. This list is not exhaustive and is not intended to cover all 
parts of a building providing protected routes of escape. For example, separating walls and 
separating floors also protect routes of escape but are cover ed by the guidance to 
Standard 2.2.  
External areas -  a roof, an external balcony or an enclosed courtyard open to the external 
air, where the area is more than 8 m2 and to which there is access for a purpose other 
than maintenance, should be regarded as a room. It is not intended that these external 
areas be treated as apartments which create inner rooms to dwellings.  
A circulation space in a dwelling is an area mainly used as a means of access and 
egress between a room and an exit (e.g. hallways and stairw ells).  
A sleeping deck within a room should be regarded as being part of that room. However 
for the purposes of the guidance to Standard 2.9, sleeping decks which do not fall within 
the definition of a gallery should be regarded as a separate room or storey as the case 
maybe.

Page 76 Applicable from 5  June 2023   2.0.7  Alternative  approaches  
Alternative means of complying with building standards -  the guidance contained 
within this Technical Handbook indicates one or sometimes more than one means of 
complying with the mandatory building standar ds 2.1 to 2.15. In the majority of projects it is 
envisaged that meeting the guidance will be the usual means of showing that compliance 
with the building standards has been achieved.  
However, it should be appreciated that, due to the generic nature of the guidance it cannot 
cover all building designs or, for example, innovative or new methods of construction.  
In such cases the designer or engineer will be required to show, by alternative means, that 
compliance with the building standards will be achieved i n the completed building. For 
example, where the elements of structure are engineered timber (including cross 
laminated timber), the structure should maintain stability during the fire growth and fully 
developed post flashover phases of the fire without reliance on intervention from the fire 
and rescue services. Encapsulation of combustible elements of structure may require to be 
provided to protect the structure against ignition and charring for the duration of the fire. 
Where encapsulation (i.e. both phys ically and in terms of the period of fire resistance 
duration) is not provided or does not protect the combustible material against ignition  and 
charring for the duration of the fire, the structural fire engineer should consider the 
additional contribution of the exposed combustible material to the fire load density 
including an assessment of the structural stability of the building due to both potential 
delamination and failure of the fixings at elevated temperatures.  
Fire safety engineering -  it is reaso nable to demonstrate compliance with the functional 
standards by alternative means and in such cases, the fire engineer, the building 
standards verifier and the fire and rescue service should be consulted early in the design 
process.  
Fire safety engineerin g may be the only practical way to achieve a satisfactory level of fire 
safety in some large and complex buildings or where innovative or new methods of 
construction are used. In such cases a holistic approach is desirable from first principles 
rather than  following, in part or wholly, the guidance contained in the Technical 
Handbooks. In such cases the building standards verifier and the fire and rescue service 
should be consulted as part of the Qualitative Design Review (QDR) process.  
For many projects it  is likely that designers will follow the guidance in the Technical 
Handbooks and fire engineering techniques will not be necessary. In its simplest form the 
QDR team may define the acceptance criteria in terms of compliance with the Handbooks.  
However, it  is common for fire engineers and regulators to be engaged relatively late in the 
design process to resolve fire safety issues raised during the verification or, in extreme 
cases, the construction process. This is unhelpful as fire engineers are often 
comm issioned to resolve specific issues where the design does not follow the guidance 
rather than assessing the building holistically. This can lead to a comparative exercise 
against unrealistic worse case scenarios of a "code compliant" design to justify devi ations. 
This is not the intent of the guidance and it is important that the safety goals are well 
defined and achieved with a sufficient margin of safety. The objective of a comparative 
study should be to demonstrate that the building design, as a whole, presents no greater 
risk to the occupants than a similar type of building designed in accordance with the 
Technical Handbook guidance. Further, it is common for the inappropriate use of 
Computational Fluid Dynamics where the deviations from the Handbooks wo uld not merit 
################# - Page 77 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 77 Applicable from 5  June 2023   such an exercise to be carried out. It is recognised that there may be instances where 
small deviations from the guidance do not warrant a "whole building" fire engineered 
design and inevitably involves a degree of negotiation without the need for detailed 
analysis.  
Not all cases of variance from the guidance will require the appointment of a fire engineer. 
Reference could be made to 'A simplified approach to alternative fire safety strategies' 
Scottish Government (2010), which provides additi onal advice.  
Existing buildings -  it may be appropriate to vary the guidance contained in this 
Handbook when assessing the guidance against the constraints in existing buildings 
especially those buildings which are listed in terms of their architectural or  historic interest. 
In such cases, it would be appropriate to take into account a range of fire safety features, 
some of which are dealt with in this Handbook and some of which are not addressed in any 
detail. For more detailed information, guidance is con tained in the 'Guide for Practitioners 6 
- Conversion of traditional buildings' (Historic Scotland).  
Fire engineering designs can be complex and many require extensive use of 
engineering judgement. The following documents are cited to ensure that the guida nce 
given encompasses best practice worldwide:  
* BS 7974: 2019 Application of fire safety engineering principles to the design of 
buildings, or  
* International Fire Engineering Guidelines, 2005 (IFEG).  
The use of either document assumes that those carrying out  or assessing a fire 
engineering approach have sufficient technical training, knowledge and experience to 
understand fully the risks involved.  
The objectives of any fire safety strategy should be established first and designers and 
verifiers should be awar e of the importance of the design assumptions. For example, the 
strategy should include an assessment of the system reliability. This will help to ensure 
that the fire safety objectives have been met.  
Responsible person -  it is important that owners/responsible person understand that the 
fire safety measures installed in a building need to be maintained and tested over the life 
time of the building so that they will operate effectively. BS 7974 and IFEG assume that all 
aspects of the fire engineering strate gy are capable of being maintained and deployed 
over the lifetime of the building. If for example, alterations are found to be necessary due 
to changes to the building layout, the original strategy may need to be re- evaluated to 
ensure the fire safety prov isions have not been compromised. For this reason, the fire 
strategy should preferably support any fire safety risk assessment required under Part 3 of 
the Fire (Scotland) Act 2005, as amended.  
Fire safety engineering involves the use of scientific based c alculations and/or statistical 
information to demonstrate an adequate level of safety for a specific building, structure or 
installation. In this regard the fire safety strategy is based on performance rather than 
prescription. Therefore fire safety engineering is about the need to identify the fire hazard, 
assess the fire risks, understand the consequences and to offer fire safety strategies and 
designs to show how the objectives have been met. The 'tools' that support fire 
engineering can include calculat ion methods which are used to demonstrate that under a 
worst reasonable case, tenable conditions are maintained during the evacuation period. 
For example, a smoke exhaust fan in a smoke reservoir within an atrium space fails to 
################# - Page 78 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 78 Applicable from 5  June 2023   operate but the smoke layer height continues to be maintained by the activation of a stand-  
by fan.  
It is recognised that fire engineering is still a rapidly developing field and as such does not 
have the standardised codes for approaching and solving problems compared to other 
engineering disciplines. The documents identified above aim to provide a structured 
framework for assessing the interaction between, buildings, people and fire, and to 
facilitate innovation in design without compromising safety. They provide information on  
how to undertake a detailed analysis of specific aspects of fire safety engineering in 
buildings.  
In practice, both frameworks provide a flexible but formalised engineering approach to fire 
safety which can be applied to new or existing buildings to show that the functional 
standards have been met.  
BS 7974: 2019 Application of fire safety engineering principles to the design of buildings is 
supported by 7 published documents:  
* Part 1: Initiation and development of fire within the enclosure of origin 
* Part 2:  Spread of smoke and toxic gases within and beyond the enclosure of origin  
* Part 3: Structural response and fire spread beyond the enclosure of origin  
* Part 4: Detection of fire and actuation of fire protection systems  
* Part 5: Fire service intervention  
* Part 6: Human factors: Life safety strategies - Occupant evacuation, behaviour and 
condition, and  
* Part 7: Probabilistic risk assessment.  
International Fire Engineering Guidelines IFEG have been developed for use in the fire 
engineering design and approval of buildings. The objectives of the guidelines are to 
provide:  
a. a link between the regulatory system and fire engineering  
b. guidance for the process of engineering, and  
c. guidance on available methodologies.  
The IFEG sub- systems bear a very close resemblance to the sub -systems used in BS 
7974: 2019 and are set out below:  
* fire initiation and development and control  
* smoke development and spread and control  
* fire spread and impact and control  
* fire detection, warning and suppression  
* occupant evacuation and control, and  
* fire services intervention.  
Clause 1.3.2 of IFEG states that "Typically, each building project is unique and similarly, 
each fire engineering evaluation is unique". It is not sensible, therefore, to set down 
detailed guidance on how the fire safety analysis should be undertaken. Instead, it is the 
################# - Page 79 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 79 Applicable from 5  June 2023   responsibility of the fire engineer to plan the analysis for the particular project, based on 
the decisions taken during the preparation of the fire engineering brief as discussed in 
Chapter 1.2.  
2.0.8  Relevant  legislation  
It is important to be aware that there is other legislation, apart from building regulations, 
imposing requirements for means of escape in case of fire and other fire safety measures 
that will come into force when the building is occupied. It is th erefore recommended that 
consultation with those responsible for such legislation takes place before the application 
for building warrant is finalised. Any necessary fire precaution requiring additional building 
work can then be included in the application.  
Part 3 of the Fire (Scotland) Act 2005 (2005 Act) , as amended introduced a fire safety 
regime which applies mainly to non- domestic buildings. The regime does not generally 
apply to domestic buildings but may apply where staff are employed or members of the 
general public have access e.g. a dental surgery within a dwelling. The regime also 
applies to domestic buildings that are licensed as Houses in Multiple Occupation and to 
some domestic buildings where certain care services are provided. Those domestic 
premises covered by Part 3 of the 2005 Act, as amended are defined in Section 78 of the 
Act. 
Persons with obligations under the Act are required to carry out a fire safety risk 
assessment which may require additional fire safety precautions to reduce the risk to life in 
case of fire. For example, measures to reduce the risk and spread of fire, means of 
escape, fire- fighting equipment, fire detection and warning, instruction and training. Other 
measures are prescribed by regulation. The fire safety risk assessment should be kept 
under continuous review.  
There is sector specific guidance for various building types on how to comply with Part 3 of 
the Act, on the Firelaw website.  
In many premises, existing fire safety measures have been incorporated in accordance 
with building regulations, however it is possible for a higher standard to be applied as a 
consequence of a fire safety risk assessment.  
Section 71 of the 2005 Act makes it clear that terms, conditions or restrictions in licences, 
including s tatutory certification or registration schemes, are to have no effect if they relate 
to fire safety requirements or prohibitions which are or could be imposed under Part 3 of 
the 2005 Act, as amended.  
The Fire Safety (Scotland) Regulations 2006 made under the Fire (Scotland) Act 2005 
and contain provisions which are part of the fire safety regime. These regulations must be 
considered along with Part 3 of the 2005 Act, as amended. The regulations contain further 
requirements in respect of fire safety risk as sessment and obligations of duty holders.  
The Construction (Design and Management) Regulations 2015 are intended to protect 
people working in construction and others who may be affected by their activities. The 
regulations require the systematic management  of projects from concept to completion 
and throughout the life cycle of the structure, including eventual demolition. The CDM 
Regulations require designers and those who control or carry out construction work to 
identify hazards associated with their desi gns or work (including risk from fire) and plan to 
eliminate, reduce or control the risks.

Page 80 Applicable from 5  June 2023   Houses in Multiple Occupation (HMOs) - Section 2 of the Domestic Technical Handbook 
should be used for multi -occupancy dwellings designed for not more than six indiv iduals 
living together as a single household. This includes houses, maisonettes and flats 
(including flatted student accommodation and cluster flats that are essentially designed as 
self-contained flats), regardless of the evacuation strategy. Section 2 Fi re of the Non-  
domestic Technical Handbook should be used for shared multi -occupancy residential 
buildings designed for more than six individuals including student accommodation 
designed on the traditional "halls of residence" principle, with bedrooms havi ng shared 
sanitary and cooking facilities.  
It should be noted that multi -occupancy dwellings and shared multi -occupancy residential 
buildings may also require to be licensed for use as a 'House in Multiple Occupation' 
(HMO) under the Civic Government (Scot land) Act 1982 (Licensing of Houses in Multiple 
Occupation) - Order 2000. In relation to fire safety aspects, HMOs which require a licence 
are also subject to Part 3 of the Fire (Scotland) Act 2005, as amended and guidance is 
available on the Firelaw websi te. 
The Care Inspectorate is responsible for regulating a diverse range of care services 
some of which are delivered in non- domestic buildings (e.g. care homes, nurseries, 
independent hospitals, hospices, residential schools, secure accommodation) and some  in 
domestic buildings (e.g. childminding, supported accommodation, adult placement 
services). The services are inspected by the Inspectorate against national care standards 
issued by Scottish Ministers some of which include physical standards for the prem ises. 
The Inspectorate consults with the fire and rescue service on fire safety matters as part of 
the care service registration process. Where the applicant for a warrant intends to use or 
provide such a service, they should consult the Inspectorate and f ire and rescue service 
for advice.  
Some care services may be provided in a domestic setting where there is a requirement to 
comply with the Fire (Scotland) Act 2005 and associated legislation e.g. any premises in 
which a "care home service" is provided wil l always fall within the scope of the legislation. 
Some, but not all, premises in which a "housing support service" is provided may also be 
required to comply e.g. where a House in Multiple Occupation licence is required, etc. It is 
important that a propor tionate approach is taken to ensure the fire safety of the occupants 
in the event of an outbreak of fire and as such, the dutyholder should take account of the 
level of dependency of the residents when carrying out a fire risk assessment. Additional 
fire s afety measures including automatic fire suppression may be required in those 
premises where highly vulnerable occupants cannot self -evacuate the building, for 
example, where the occupant is bed- ridden or has limited mental capacity and may not 
respond to t he fire alarm.  
Where care services are to be provided in a domestic setting to which the Fire (Scotland) 
Act 2005 does not apply, the safety of the occupants in the event of an outbreak of fire 
must still be considered. Any fire safety risk assessment should take account of the level 
of dependency of the residents. For example, it may be appropriate to consider fire safety 
equipment such as portable fire suppression and automatic cut -off devices for cookers 
depending on the risk identified.  
'Practical Fire Safety Guidance for existing Specialised Housing and similar premises' 
provides guidance for many domestic premises where the Fire (Scotland) Act 2005 does 
not apply. In those cases it is recommended that a fire safety risk assessment (of both the 
building and the person) is the best way to protect residents from the risk of fire.

Annex 2.A -  Resistance to fire  
Resistance to fire is expressed in terms of fire resistance duration and reference 
throughout this document to a short,  medium or long fire resistance duration, are explained 
in annex 2.A. The performance levels include properties such as loadbearing capacity, 
integrity and insulation.  
Annex 2B -  Reaction to fire  
Reaction to fire of construction products is expressed as European Classification A1, A2, 
B, C, D, E and F (with A1 being the highest performance and F being the lowest).  
The performance levels include properties such as ease of ignition and rate at which the 
product gives off heat when burning. Further explanation  is provided in annex 2.B 
including sub- indices for smoke production and/or flaming droplets/particles.  
Annex 2C -  Vulnerability of roof coverings  
Roof coverings are expressed in terms of low, medium or high vulnerability and explained 
in annex 2.C. The performance levels relate to the capability of a roof to resist penetration 
from fire and flame spread when the external surface is exposed to radiation and flames.  
2.0.10  Independent third party certification and accreditation  
Independent third- party certif ication or accreditation can be used as evidence towards 
demonstrating compliance with building regulations. Certification provides third- party 
confirmation via audit of an organisation's systems or products. Accreditation is 
independent third- party recognition that an organisation has the competence and 
impartiality to perform specific technical activities such as certification, testing and 
inspection.  
Third party certification of installers of systems, materials, products or structures provides 
a means of  ensuring that installations have been conducted by knowledgeable contractors 
to appropriate standards, thereby increasing the reliability of the anticipated performance 
in fire.  
Confidence that the required level of performance can be achieved will be dem onstrated 
by the use of product and installer certification schemes that are accredited.  
Such certification schemes not only provide a means of identifying materials and designs 
of systems, products or structures which have demonstrated that they have the requisite 
performance in fire, but additionally provide confidence that the systems, materials, 
products or structures actually supplied are provided to the same specification or design as 
that tested and assessed.  
The 'Guide to Undertaking Technical Asses sments of Fire Performance of Construction 
Products Based on Fire Test Evidence' (Passive Fire Protection Forum, 2021) provides 
advice including the competency of those undertaking technical assessments linked to 
levels of complexity. The guidance promotes  effective fire safety design to ensure the 
reliability and quality of passive fire protection materials and systems. The guide also 
encourages third party certification schemes for the manufacture, installation, inspection 
and maintenance of products and systems, and relates to the provision of technical 
assessments that can extend the scope of design and application of a passive product or 
system by providing a robust and competent approach to technical assessments.

Page 83 Applicable from 5  June 2023   2.1 Compartmentation  
Mandatory Standard  
Standard 2.1  
Every building must be designed and constructed in such a way that in the 
event of an outbreak of fire within the building, fire and smoke are inhibited from 
spreading beyond the compartment of origin until any occupants have had the 
time to leave that com partment and any fire containment measures have been 
initiated.  
Limitation:  
This Standard does not apply to domestic buildings.  
 
 
2.1.0  Introduction 
This standard does not apply to dwellings and other domestic buildings.  
 
  
################# - Page 84 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 84 Applicable from 5  June 2023   2.2 Separation  
Mandatory Standar d 
Standard 2.2  
Every building, which is divided into more than one area of different occupation, 
must be designed and constructed in such a way that in the event of an 
outbreak of fire within the building, fire and smoke are inhibited from spreading 
beyond the area of occupation where the fire originated . 
 
 
2.2.0  Introduction 
In order to reduce the risk of fire spreading from one dwelling to another, fire separation 
should be provided between dwellings and between dwellings and any common spaces. 
Such separ ation should form a complete barrier to the products of combustion; smoke, 
heat and toxic gases. In semi -detached or terraced houses, or between flats or 
maisonettes, the barrier will normally be in the form of fire resisting walls and floors where 
appropr iate. 
The guidance in clause 2.2.9 (Openings and service penetrations) and clause 2.2.10 
(Junctions) is common, not only to separation, but also to the relevant guidance in 
Standard 2.4 Cavities and Standard 2.9 Escape.  
Conversions - in the case of convers ions, as specified in regulation 4, the building as 
converted shall meet the requirements of this standard in so far as is reasonably 
practicable, and in no case be worse than before the conversion (regulation 12, schedule 
6). 
2.2.1  Dwellings in different  occupation  
A separating wall or separating floor with at least a medium fire resistance duration should 
be provided between adjoining dwellings.  
2.2.2  Dwellings with common  occupation 
A separating wall or separating floor with at least a medium fire resistance duration should 
be provided between a dwelling and any other part of the building in common occupation. 
A protected zone and a common access corridor should be considered as being in 
common occupation. Any self -closing fire door installed in these separating walls should 
have at least a short fire resistance duration and in the case of a high rise domestic 
building, a medium fire resistance duration. For ancillary rooms and spaces, common 
external escape stairs or open access balconies, see the g uidance to Standard 2.9.  
2.2.3  Separation between domestic and non-domestic buildings  
A separating wall or separating floor with at least a medium fire resistance duration should 
be provided between a domestic and non- domestic building. Reference should al so be 
made to the guidance for non- domestic buildings where appropriate.  
################# - Page 85 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 85 Applicable from 5  June 2023   2.2.4  Domestic  garages  
There is a risk posed by the storage of combustible materials and other highly flammable 
substances in garages which are integral or attached to a dwelling.  
A separating wall or separating floor with a short fire resistance duration therefore should 
be provided between an integral or attached garage and a dwelling in the same 
occupation. It is not necessary for a roof space above the garage to be separated from t he 
dwelling where the garage ceiling will serve as a separating floor with a short fire 
resistance duration (see annex 2.A).  
2.2.5  Lift wells  
Every lift well should be enclosed by separating walls with a medium fire resistance 
duration. Where the lift well  does not extend the full height of the building, the lift well 
should form a junction with a separating floor with a medium fire resistance duration. 
Where a lift is installed, the landing controls and lift car controls should be of a type that do 
not operate on heat or pressure resulting from a fire.  
A platform lift constructed in accordance with the guidance in BS 6440: 1999 (see Section 
4 Safety), need not be enclosed by separating walls or separating floors.  
2.2.6  Combustibility  
Separating Walls -  in a building with no storey at a height above 18 m, separating walls 
may be constructed from combustible products provided the appropriate fire resistance 
duration is achieved.  
To reduce the risk of a fire starting within a combustible separating wall or a fi re spreading 
rapidly on or within the wall construction:  
* insulation exposed in a cavity should be constructed from products which achieve 
European Classification A1, A2, or B, and  
* the internal wall linings should be constructed from products which achieve European 
Classification A1, A2, or B, and  
* the wall should contain no pipes, wires or other services.  
Where an opening is created to allow services to pass through the wall, the opening 
should be constructed in accordance with the guidance in clause 2.2.9.  
Separating floors -  in a domestic building with no storey at a height above 18 m, 
separating floors may be constructed from combustible products provided the appropriate 
fire resistance duration is achieved.  
Where a domestic building also contains non -domestic accommodation, every part of that 
separating floor (other than a floor finish e.g. laminate flooring) should be constructed from 
products which achieve European Classification A1 or A2. This is not necessary for a floor:  
* between a shop or office and a  dwelling above the shop or office in the same 
occupation where there is no other dwelling above the shop or office, and the area of 
the shop or office is not more than 1 1/2 times the area of the separating floor, or  
################# - Page 86 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 86 Applicable from 5  June 2023   * above a pend where the floor has at least  medium fire resistance duration and the 
ceiling of the pend is constructed from products which achieve European Classification 
A1 or A2, or  
* between a domestic building and a unit of shared residential accommodation.  
2.2.7  High rise domestic  buildings  
Occupants in high rise domestic buildings may not evacuate the building immediately and 
fire-fighting and rescue operations will take longer to commence if the fire is on a floor high 
above the ground. Therefore in order to improve occupant and fire- fighte r safety in high 
rise domestic buildings every:  
* separating wall, separating floor and open access balcony should be constructed from 
products which achieve European Classification A1 or A2,  
* separating floor and open access balcony should have a long fire r esistance duration, 
and 
* separating wall including any self -closing fire door, should have at least a medium fire 
resistance duration.  
2.2.8  Supporting  structure  
Where an element of structure (see clause 2.3.0) provides support to a separating wall or 
separ ating floor constructed from products which achieve European Classification A1 or 
A2, the supporting element of structure should also achieve European Classification A1 or 
A2. 
Where an element of structure provides support to a separating wall or separating floor 
which attracts a higher fire resistance duration, the supporting element of structure should 
have at least the same fire resistance duration.  
2.2.9  Openings and service  penetrations  
General - Separating walls and separating floors are intended to prevent fire passing from 
one part of the building to another part under different occupation. Openings and service 
penetrations through these walls or floors can compromise their effectiveness and should 
be kept to a minimum. The solum and roof -space should not be forgotten. Openings and 
service penetrations should be carefully detailed and constructed to resist fire. This can be 
achieved by following the guidance below.  
A self -closing fire door with the same fire resistance duration as the separat ing wall 
should be installed in accordance with the recommendations in the Code of Practice, 
'Hardware for Fire and Escape Doors', published by the Door and Hardware Federation 
and the Guild of Architectural Ironmongers.  
In some instances a self -closing fi re door with a short fire resistance duration may be 
installed. For example in a separating wall between a dwelling and a common space (see 
clause 2.2.2).  
A self -closing fire door should not be fitted in a separating wall between 2 dwellings in 
different o ccupation.  
################# - Page 87 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 87 Applicable from 5  June 2023   A lockable door to a cupboard or service duct with a floor area not more than 3 m2 need 
not be self -closing.  
Hold open devices - Self-closing fire doors can be fitted with hold open devices as 
specified in BS 5839: Part 3: 1988 provided the door is not an emergency door, a 
protected door serving the only escape stair in the building (or the only escape stair 
serving part of the building) or a protected door serving a fire- fighting shaft.  
It is important that hold open devices deactivate on operati on of the fire alarm therefore 
some buildings will need automatic fire detection to be installed. Electrically operated hold 
open devices should therefore deactivate on operation of:  
* an automatic fire alarm system designed and installed in accordance with BS 5839: 
Part 1: 2017 (Category L5) determined on the basis of a risk assessment  
* any loss of power to the hold open device, apparatus or switch, and  
* a manually operated switch fitted in a position at the door.  
An example of a Category L5 fire alarm system could be a system installed in the common 
corridor of flats incorporating only 2 smoke detectors, one installed on each side of the 
door and positioned not less than 500 mm and not more than 3 m from the door.  
Additional guidance on the siting and coverage of fire detectors is contained in BS 5839: 
Part 1: 2017, and for actuation of door release mechanism, see BS 7273: Part 4: 2015.  
A chimney or flue -pipe should be constructed so that, in the event of a fire, the fire 
resistance duration of the separating w all or separating floor is maintained.  
A service opening (other than a ventilating duct) which penetrates a separating wall or 
separating floor should be fire stopped providing at least the appropriate fire resistance 
duration for the wall or floor. This m ay be provided by:  
* a casing which has at least the appropriate fire resistance duration from the outside, or  
* a casing which has at least half the appropriate fire resistance duration from each side, 
or 
* an automatic heat activated sealing device that will m aintain the appropriate fire 
resistance duration in respect of integrity for the wall or floor regardless of the opening 
size. 
Fire stopping of the following services passing through a separating wall or separating 
floor need not be provided for:  
* a pipe or  a cable with a bore, or diameter, of not more than 40 mm, or  
* not more than four 40 mm diameter pipes or cables that are at least 40 mm apart and 
at least 100 mm from any other pipe, or  
* more than four 40 mm diameter pipes or cables that are at least 100 mm  apart, or  
* a pipe which has a bore of not more than 160 mm and is of iron, steel or copper, or of 
a material capable of withstanding 800 oC without allowing flames or hot material to 
pass through the wall of the pipe, or  
* a branch pipe of a bore of not more than 110 mm connected to a vertical drainage or 
water service pipe, constructed from aluminium, aluminium alloy, or uPVC to BS 4514: 
2001.  
################# - Page 88 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 88 Applicable from 5  June 2023   Where a pipe connects to another pipe which attracts a more demanding fire resistance 
duration, and is within 1 m fr om the separating wall or separating floor, the pipe should be 
fire stopped to the more demanding guidance.  
Ventilation systems -  the potential for ventilation systems to allow the spread of fire and 
smoke should be considered. A mechanical ventilation sys tem may contribute to the 
spread of fire and smoke unless it is designed to shut down automatically or operate in  a 
fire-mode if fire is detected. Ventilation ductwork passing through a separating wall or 
separating floor should be provided with either:  
* fire dampers  
* fire resisting enclosures, or  
* fire rated ductwork.  
Ventilation ductwork should be designed and installed in accordance with BS 5588: Part 9: 
1999. Section 6 of BS 5588: Part 9: 1999 (excluding the third paragraph to clause 
6.3.3.2.2) provides guidance on design and construction including fire resisting enclosures, 
fire resisting ductwork and the use and activation of fire dampers.  
Fire-stopping - may be necessary to close an imperfection of fit or design tolerance 
between construction elements and components, service openings and ventilation ducts. 
Proprietary fire -stopping products, including intumescent products, should be tested to 
demonstrate their ability to maintain the appropriate fire resistance duration under the 
conditions appropriate to their end use.  
Where minimal differential movement is anticipated, either in normal use or during fire 
exposure, proprietary fire- stopping products may be used. The following materials are also 
considered appropriate: cement mortar; gypsum based plaster; cement or gypsum based 
vermiculite/perlite mixes; mineral fibre; crushed rock and blast furnace slag or ceramic 
based products (with or without resin binders).  
Where greater differential movement is anticipated, either in normal use or during fi re 
exposure, proprietary fire- stopping products should be used.  
To prevent displacement , products used for fire- stopping should be reinforced with, or 
supported by, products which achieve European Classification A1 or A2 where the 
unsupported span is more than 100 mm and where non- rigid products are used. However 
this is not necessary where it has been shown by test that the products are satisfactory 
within their field of application.  
2.2.10  Junctions  
General - the basic principle is that junctions between separating walls and separating 
floors and other parts of the building should be designed and constructed to minimise the 
risk of a fire in one part of the building flanking the separating wall or separating floor and 
entering another part of the building under different occupation, including any solum space 
or roof space. Therefore, the building elements, materials or components should not be 
built into, or carried through or across the ends of, or over the top of a separating wall in 
such a way as to impair the fire resistance duration between the relevant parts of the 
building.  
Technical assessments are often required when designing or verifying the fire 
performance of junction details. The 'Guide to Undertaking Technical Assessments of Fire 
################# - Page 89 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 89 Applicable from 5  June 2023   Performance of Construction Products Based on Fire Test Evidence' (Passive Fire 
Protection Forum, 2021) provides advice including the competency of those undertaking 
technical assessments linked to levels of complexity. The guidance promotes effective fire 
safety desig n to ensure the reliability and quality of passive fire protection materials and 
systems. The guide also encourages third party certification schemes for the manufacture, 
installation, inspection and maintenance of products and systems, and relates to the 
provision of technical assessments that can extend the scope of design and application of 
a passive product or system by providing a robust and competent approach to technical 
assessments.  
Junctions with walls - Where a separating wall or separating fl oor forms a junction with 
an external wall, another separating wall, or a wall or screen used to protect routes of 
escape (see clause 2.0.6), the junction should maintain the fire resistance duration of the 
separating wall or separating floor.  
Where a separating wall or floor or protected route of escape abuts a structure containing 
a cavity, a fire barrier or barriers should be installed in the cavity so as to extend the line, 
and maintain the fire resistance duration, of the wall or floor. This principle also applies 
where an external wall cladding system is constructed from materials having a European 
Classification A1 or A2 (other than between two leaves of masonry as described below). 
For example, in a rendered external thermally insulated cladding syst em where the 
insulation achieves European Classification B, C, D, E or F, a fire barrier or barriers should 
be provided on the line of the separating wall or floor. The barrier should extend from the 
wall/floor to the inner surface of the render (this may require an intumescent barrier within 
any drainage cavity that may be present). The guidance in this clause does not apply 
where the external wall is formed by two leaves of masonry or concrete where both leaves 
are at least 75 mm thick and the external wall is provided with cavity barriers around all 
openings and at the top of the wall -head.  
There are merits in testing products in a large scale facade fire test to assess how the 
individual components perform in a complete assembly when exposed to a severe fire 
emanating from a window or door opening (see annex 2B).  
Junctions with roofs - where a separating wall forms a junction with a roof, the junction 
should maintain the fire resistance duration of the separating wall in accordance with the 
following:  
* where the roof has a combustible substrate, the wall should project through the roof to 
a distance of at least 375 mm above the top surface of the roof, or  
* where the wall is taken to the underside of a roof substrate which achieves European 
Classification A1 or A2, the junction should be fire stopped and the roof covering 
should be low vulnerability (see guidance to Standard 2.8) for a distance of at least 1.7 
m to each side of the centre- line of the wall, or  
* in the case of a pitched roof covered by slates nai led directly to sarking and underlay, 
the junction between the sarking and wall -head should be fire- stopped as described in 
BRE Housing Defects Prevention Unit "Defect Action Sheet (Design)" February 1985 
(DAS 8), or  
* in the case of a pitched roof covered by slates or tiles fixed to tiling battens and any 
counter -battens, the junction between the tiles or slates and the underlay should be 
fully bedded in cement mortar (or other fire- stopping material) at the  wall-head.

Page 90 Applicable from 5  June 2023   2.3 Structural  protection  
Mandatory St andard  
Standard 2.3  
Every building must be designed and constructed in such a way that in the 
event of an outbreak of fire within the building, the load- bearing capacity of the 
building will continue to function until all occupants have escaped, or been 
assisted to escape, from the building and any fire containment measures have 
been initiated.  
 
 
2.3.0  Introduction 
In order to prevent the premature collapse of the load- bearing structural elements of a 
building, appropriate levels of fire resistance duration (see annex 2.A) should be provided 
to all element of structure. The purpose of structural fire protection is:  
* to minimise the risk to the occupants, some of whom may not evacuate the building 
immediately, and  
* to reduce the risk to fire- fighters who may be engaged in fire- fighting or rescue 
operations.  
An element of structure may perform more than one function and it is important that the 
appropriate guidance related to the different standards is followed.  
The a dded benefit to structural fire protection means that the risk to people in the vicinity of 
the building or in adjoining buildings from collapse of the structure is reduced.  
An element of structure is part of a building which is part of a structural frame (beams and 
columns), load- bearing (other than part which is only self load- bearing), a floor, or supports 
a floor. An example of part of the structure that is only self load- bearing could be a lintel in 
a non load- bearing wall. A roof structure should not be considered as an element of 
structure unless the roof provides support to an element of structure or which performs the 
function of a floor.  
Conversions - in the case of conversions, as specified in regulation 4, the building as 
converted shall meet the requirement of this standard (regulation 12, schedule 6).  
2.3.1  Element of structure  
It is essential that during a fire the elements of structure should continue to function. They 
should remain capable of supporting and retaining the fire protection to fl oors, escape 
routes and fire access routes, until all occupants have escaped, been assisted to escape 
or rescued by the fire and rescue service. In practice, the fire and rescue service could 
remain in the building long after it has been evacuated. For thi s reason, an additional level 
of protection is built into the guidance for domestic buildings that varies depending on the 
height of the topmost storey of the building.

1. An intermediate floor or floors within a flat or maisonette need only have short fire 
resistance duration provided the floor or floors do not support or provide lateral 
restraint to any part of the structure with a medium or long fire resistance duration.  
However the following elements of structure need not be provided with any f ire resistance 
duration for structural protection:  
* an element of structure in a single storey building which does not form part of, or 
provide support to, a separating wall, a wall or screen used to protect routes of escape 
(see clause 2.0.6) or an external wall which attracts a fire resistance duration (see 
guidance to Standard 2.6)  
* a gallery floor other than a gallery floor which is wholly or partly enclosed below  
* the lowest floor of a building.  
2.3.2  Combustibility  
An element of structure in a building (other than a high rise domestic buildings) may be 
constructed from combustible material provided the construction achieves the appropriate 
fire resistance duration.  
However, where an element of structure provides support to another element of str ucture 
(or a protected route of escape, see clause 2.0.6) which should be constructed from 
products that achieve European Classification A1 or A2, the supporting element of 
structure should also be constructed from products that achieve European Classification 
A1 or A2 (see annex 2.B).  
2.3.3  Supporting  structure  
Where an element of structure provides support to another element of structure (or 
provides support to a protected route of escape) which attracts a higher period of fire 
resistance duration, the supporting element of structure should have at least the same 
period of fire resistance duration.  
2.3.4  Openings and service  penetrations  
In general, openings and service penetrations in element of structure need not be 
protected from fire unless there is th e possibility of structural failure. However where a 
large opening or a large number of small openings are formed, careful detailing particularly 
at the edge of the opening or service penetration should be carried out in order to maintain 
the load- bearing capacity of the element of structure. If in doubt, edge protection should be 
provided.

The detailing of junctions between relevant parts of a building is described in clauses 
2.2.10, 2.4.7 and 2.9.21. Fire- stopping of other junctions is generally not necessary. The 
important criteria to consider is the ability of the element of structure to maintain its load-  
bearing capacity in a fire in accordance with clause 2.3.1.

Page 93 Applicable from 5  June 2023   2.4 Cavities 
Mandatory Standard  
Standard 2.4  
Every building must be desi gned and constructed in such a way that in the 
event of an outbreak of fire within the building, the spread of fire and smoke 
within cavities in its structure and fabric is inhibited.  
 
 
2.4.0  Introduction 
Fire and smoke spread in cavities is particularly hazardous because fire can spread quickly 
throughout a building and remain undetected by the occupants of the building or by fire 
and rescue service personnel. Ventilated cavities generally promote more rapid fire spread 
around the building than unventilated cavities due to the plentiful supply of air. Buildings 
containing sleeping accommodation pose an even greater risk to life safety and demand a 
higher level of fire precautions. For these reasons, it is important to control the size of 
cavities and the surfaces exposed in the cavity.  
The guidance for protection to cavities should not be assessed in isolation and reference 
should be made to the guidance to Standard 2.2 for separation, Standard 2.6 for spread to 
adjoining buildings and the guidance to Standard 2.7 for fire spread on external walls.  
A cavity is a concealed space enclosed by elements of a building (including, for example, 
the void above a suspended ceiling) or contained within a building element, but not a 
room, cupboard, circulation space, stair enclosure, lift well, chimney or a space within a 
chute, duct, pipe or conduit. For the purposes of this guidance, a cavity includes a roof 
space, a service riser or any other space used to run services around the building.  
Reference to surfaces in a cavity is intended to include the surface of the enclosing 
envelope of the cavity (including insulation material) but excludes timber roof trusses or 
lintols, joist ends, pipes, conduits or cables.  
Conversions - in the case of conversions, as specified in regulation 4, the building as 
converted shall meet the requirements of this standard in so far as is reasonably 
practicable, and in no case be worse than before the conversion (regulation 12, schedule 
6). 
2.4.1  Cavity  barriers  
A cavity barrier means any cons truction provided to seal a cavity against the penetration of 
fire and smoke or to restrict its movement within the cavity.  
In order to inhibit fire spread in a cavity, every cavity within a building should have cavity 
barriers with at least a short fire r esistance duration (see annex 2.A) installed around the 
edges of the cavity. This includes for example, around the head, jambs and sill of an 
external door or window opening. A cavity barrier should also be installed between a cavity 
and any other cavity or between a roof space and any other roof space.  
################# - Page 94 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 94 Applicable from 5  June 2023   However cavity barriers are not necessary at a junction between two cavity walls each 
comprising two leaves of masonry or concrete where both leaves are at least 75 mm thick.  
Sealing cavities can sometimes c reate difficulties, especially where construction 
techniques rely on through ventilation of the cavity (see Section 3 Environment) or where 
the detailing should take into account the effect of thermal bridging (see Section 6 Energy).  
In an external wall, open state intumescent cavity barriers may be used to inhibit fire and 
smoke spread and seal the cavity. It is recognised that smoke will spread beyond the 
cavity barrier at the incipient and early fire growth phases prior to the intumescent material  
reacting to heat but this is not considered to be a major concern as the cavity is ventilated 
to atmosphere.  
2.4.2  Dividing up  cavities 
Cavities should be measured either horizontally or vertically, as the case maybe, along the 
centre- line of the cavity and not diagonally.  
Every cavity should be divided by cavity barriers so that the maximum distance between 
cavity barriers is not more than 20 m where the cavity has exposed surfaces which 
achieve European Classification A1, A2 or B, or 10 m where the cavit y has exposed 
surfaces which achieve European Classification C, D, E or F.  
Exclusions - cavity barriers are not necessary to divide a cavity:  
d. formed by two leaves of masonry or concrete where both leaves are at least 75 mm 
thick, or  
e. in a ceiling void betwe en a floor and a ceiling constructed in accordance with the 
guidance in clause 2.4.3, or  
f. between a roof and a ceiling constructed in accordance with the guidance in clause 
2.4.3, or  
g. below a floor next to the ground where the cavity is either inaccessible or is not more 
than 1 m high.  
2.4.3  Fire resisting ceilings as an alternative to cavity barriers  
Where a ceiling is provided as an alternative to cavity barriers as in clauses 2.4.2b and 
2.4.2c, the ceiling should have a short fire resistance duration, and be constructed in 
accordance with the following recommendations:  
* the ceiling should not be easily demountable  
* openings and service penetrations in the ceiling should be protected in accordance 
with clause 2.2.9  
* the ceiling lining should be constructed in accordance with the guidance to Standard  
2.5 
* the ceiling may contain an access hatch which, when closed, will maintain the fire 
resistance duration of the ceiling.

Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 95 Applicable from 5  June 2023   2.4.4  Cavities in external walls of domestic buildings with a storey at a 
height of 11 m or more above the ground 
Fire-fighters may not be able to apply a water jet from a fire- fighting hose directly onto a 
fire that has spread within an external wall or onto an external wall. This is because the 
external wall is either inaccessible or is too high above the ground to be within  the reach 
capability of fire -fighting equipment such as hydraulic platforms or turntable ladders, 
therefore, the construction of external walls should not contribute to the development of 
fire or contribute to fire spread  within cavities or vertical fire spread up the facade of the 
building. Fire- fighters may require to cut holes in the external envelope of a building in 
order to gain access to the cavity to extinguish or control fire spread in the cavity. This can 
be part icularly challenging when the cavity is ventilated and the surfaces exposed in the 
cavity promote rapid fire spread. See also the guidance to Standard 2.2, Standard 2.6 and 
Standard 2.7.  
Therefore, in a domestic building with a storey at a height of 11 m or more above the 
ground, thermal insulation material situated or exposed within an external wall cavity, or in 
a cavity formed by an external wall cladding system, must be constructed of products 
which achieve European Classification A1 or A2 (see annex 2. B). However, this does not 
apply to insulation in a cavity that is between two leaves of masonry or concrete where 
both leaves are at least 75 mm thick and the external wall is provided with cavity barriers 
around all openings and at the top of the wall -head.  
2.4.5  Supporting  structure  
A cavity barrier should be fixed so that its performance is not affected by:  
* movement of the building due to subsidence, shrinkage or thermal collapse in a fire of 
any services penetrating it  
* failure in a fire of its fixings,  or 
* failure in a fire of any material or element of structure which it  abuts.  
However where a cavity barrier is installed in a roof space, there is no need to protect roof 
members that support the cavity barrier.  
2.4.6  Openings and service  penetrations  
A cavity barrier and a ceiling provided as an alternative to a cavity barrier may contain a 
self-closing fire door (or a hatch in the case of a ceiling), or a service opening constructed 
in accordance with the guidance in clause 2.2.9.  
2.4.7  Junctions  
All cavity barriers should be tightly fitted to rigid construction. Where this is not possible as 
in the case of a junction with tiles, corrugated sheeting or other forms of construction 
containing a cavity, the fire performance of the junction sh ould be maintained. The 
guidance to standard 2.2 including fire barriers and fire stopping may be used to satisfy 
standard 2.4.

Page 96 Applicable from 5  June 2023   2.5 Internal  linings  
Mandatory Standard  
Standard 2.5  
Every building must be designed and constructed in such a way that in the  
event of an outbreak of fire within the building, the development of fire and 
smoke from the surfaces of walls and ceilings within the area of origin is 
inhibited.  
 
 
2.5.0  Introduction 
The building contents are likely to be the first items ignited in a fi re and are beyond the 
scope of this guidance. Materials used in walls and ceilings can however significantly 
affect the spread of fire and its rate of growth. Fire spread on internal linings in escape 
routes is particularly important because rapid fire spr ead in protected zones and 
unprotected zones could prevent the occupants from escaping.  
The use of highly combustible metal composite material panels referred to and defined in 
Regulation 8 of the Building (Scotland) Amendment Regulations 2022 is prohibite d. 
Conversions - in the case of conversions, as specified in regulation 4, the building as 
converted shall meet the requirement of this standard (regulation 12, schedule 6).  
2.5.1  Internal  linings  
Wall and ceiling surfaces mean the substrate or lining material including any treatment 
thereof to restrict flame spread, but excludes any decorative wallpaper or paints. Whilst it is 
accepted that such wallpaper or paints are not controlled by the guidance, multiple layers 
applied to the face of a wall or ceiling surface can increase flame spread and hence the  
fire growth rate. For this reason, multiple layers are not recommended when carrying out 
refurbishment work involving the re- decoration of wall and ceiling surfaces.  
A protected zone should have wall and ceiling surfaces which achieve European 
Classification A1, A2 or B (see annex 2.B).  
A room, unprotected zone or protected enclosure should have wall and ceiling surfaces 
with a reaction to fire no worse than European Classification C.  
Limitations on higher r isk surfaces - a room (other than a kitchen) not more than 4 m2 
may have wall and ceiling linings with a European Classification D. In a room (other than a 
kitchen) more than 4 m2 the wall surfaces may also have a European Classification D 
subject to a max imum of 20 m2 where the total area of European Classification D products 
is not more than half the floor area of the room.  
2.5.2  Assessment of  linings  
Wall and ceiling linings should be assessed for their reaction to fire characteristics.  
Wall linings -  the following wall surfaces should be included in the assessment:  
################# - Page 97 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 97 Applicable from 5  June 2023   * glazing except glazing in doors, and  
* any part of a ceiling which slopes at an angle of more than 70o to the horizontal.  
However the following surfaces need not be taken into account:  
* doors and door frames  
* window frames and frames in which glazing is fitted  
* skirtings and facings, cover moulds , picture rails, and similar narrow members, or  
* fireplace  surrounds, mantle shelves and fitted furniture.  
Ceiling linings -  the following ceiling surfaces should be included in the assessment:  
* the surface of glazing, and  
* any part of a ceiling which slopes at an angle of 70o or less to the horizontal.  
However the following need not be taken into account:  
* ceiling hatches and their frames, and  
* the frames of windows or rooflights and the frames in which glazing is fitted, or  
* facings, cover moulds, picture rails, and similar narrow members.  
2.5.3  Plastic  glazing 
External windows and internal glazing to rooms (but not to protected zone or unprotected 
zones) may be fitted with plastic glazing materials which are:  
* rigid solid PVC (uPVC), or  
* polycarbonat e rigid solid sheet at least 3 mm thick, or  
* multi- skin polycarbonate sheet at least 10 mm thick overall which achieves European 
Classification B or C.  
2.5.4  Thermoplastic  material  
Thermoplastic materials in ceilings, rooflights and lighting diffusers provi de a significant 
hazard in a fire. Burning droplets can rapidly increase the fire growth rate and the smoke 
produced is normally dense and toxic which combine to produce extremely hazardous 
conditions. For these reasons, thermoplastic material should not be used in protected 
zones or fire- fighting shafts. However thermoplastic materials may still be used with limited 
application for some ceilings (see clause 2.5.5), rooflights (see clause 2.5.6) or light fittings 
with diffusers (see clause 2.5.7).  
A thermoplastic material means any synthetic material that has a softening point below 
200o C when tested in accordance with BS EN ISO 306: 2004 Method A120 Plastics -  
Thermoplastic Materials -  Determination of Vicat softening temperature.  
Rigid Thermoplastic TP(a)  rigid means:  
* rigid solid (solid as distinct from double or multiple- skin) polycarbonate sheet at least 3 
mm thick, or  
################# - Page 98 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 98 Applicable from 5  June 2023   * multi- skinned rigid sheet made from unplasticised pvc or polycarbonate which has 
European Classification B or C for reaction to fire, or  
* any other rigid thermoplastic product, a specimen of which (at the thickness of the 
product as put on the market), when tested in accordance with Method 508A in BS 
2782: 2004 performs so that the test flame extinguishes before the first mark, and the 
durat ion of flaming or afterglow does not exceed 5 seconds following removal of the 
burner.  
Flexible Thermoplastic TP(a) flexible means:  
* flexible products not more than 1 mm thick which satisfy the Type C provisions of BS 
5867: Part 2: 1980 (1993) when tested in accordance with Test 2 in BS 5438: 1989 
(1995) with the flame applied to the surface of the specimens for 5, 15, 20 and 30 
seconds  respectively, but excluding cleansing procedure.  
Semi -rigid Thermoplastic TP(b) semi -rigid means:  
* a rigid solid polycarbonate sheet product not more than 3 mm thick, or multiple -skin 
polycarbonate sheet products which do not qualify as TP(a) by test, or  
* other products which, when a specimen of the material more than 1.5 mm and not 
more than 3 mm thick is tested in accordance with Method 508A in BS 2782: 2004, 
has a rate of burning which is not more than 50 mm/minute.  
2.5.5  Thermoplastic materials in ceilings  
A ceiling constructed from thermoplastic materials, either as a suspended or stretched skin 
membrane with a TP(a) flexible classification should be supported on all its sides and each 
panel should not exceed 5 m2. However this does not apply to a ceiling which has been 
satisfactorily tested as part of a fire resisting ceiling system. A ceiling with a TP(a) flexible 
classification should not be installed in the ceiling of a protected zone or fire- fighting shaft.  
Subject to the recommendations in clauses 2 .5.6 and 2.5.7, the use of thermoplastic 
materials with a TP(a) rigid or TP(b) semi -rigid classification is unlimited.  
2.5.6  Thermoplastic materials in rooflights  
Thermoplastic materials (other than TP(a) flexible) may be used in rooflights subject to the 
recommendations in the table and diagram below.  
Thermoplastic rooflights should also be constructed in accordance with the guidance to 
Standard 2.8.  
2.5.7  Thermoplastic materials in light fittings with diffusers  
Thermoplastic materials may be used in light  fittings with diffusers. Where the lighting 
diffuser forms an integral part of the ceiling, the size and disposition of the lighting diffusers 
should be installed in accordance with the table and diagram below.  
However where the lighting diffuser form an integral part of a fire- resisting ceiling which 
has been satisfactorily tested, the amount of thermoplastic material is unlimited.  
################# - Page 99 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 99 Applicable from 5  June 2023   Where light fittings with thermoplastic diffusers do not form an integral part of the ceiling, 
the amount of thermoplastic ma terial is unlimited provided the lighting diffuser is designed 
to fall out of its mounting when softened by heat.

Page 102 Applicable from 5  June 2023   2.6 Spread to neighbouring  buildings  
Mandatory Standard  
Standard 2.6  
Every building must be designed and constructed in such a way that in the 
event of an outbreak of fire within the building, the spread of fire to 
neighbouring buildings is inhibited.  
 
 
2.6.0  Introduction 
In order to reduce the danger to the occupants of other buildings, one building should be 
isolated from another by either construction or distance. The distance between a building 
and its relevant boundary is dictated by the amount of heat that is likely to be generated in 
the event of fire. This will be influenced by the extent of openings or other unprotected 
areas in the external wall of the building.  
The guidance for fire spread to neighbouring buildings should not be assessed in isolation 
and reference should be made to the guidance to Standard 2.4 for fire spread in cavities 
and the guidance to Standard 2.7 for fire spread on external w alls. 
The use of highly combustible metal composite material panels referred to and defined in 
Regulation 8 of the Building (Scotland) Amendment Regulations 2022 is prohibited.  
Conversions - in the case of conversions, as specified in regulation 4, the bui lding as 
converted shall meet the requirements of this standard in so far as is  reasonably 
practicable, and in no case be worse than before the conversion (regulation 12, schedule 
6). 
2.6.1  Fire resistance duration of external  walls  
Apart from unprotected areas, as described in clause 2.6.2, external walls should have:  
* short fire resistance duration, if more than 1 m from the boundary,  or 
* medium fire resistance duration, if not more than 1 m from the boundary.  
However short fire resistance duration is sufficient even if not more than 1 m from the 
boundary, for the following:  
* a detached building ancillary to a dwelling comprising a garden hut or store, or a 
building for keeping animals, birds or other livestock for domestic purposes  
* a conservatory or por ch attached to a dwelling,  or 
* a garage wall.  
Fire resistance duration need not be provided for a building ancillary to a dwelling, 
comprising a carport, covered area, greenhouse, summerhouse, or swimming pool 
enclosure unless the building contains oil or l iquefied petroleum gas fuel storage (see 
section 3 and section 4).  
################# - Page 103 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 103 Applicable from 5  June 2023   2.6.2  Unprotected  area 
An unprotected area means any part of an external wall (including a door or window 
opening) which does not attain the appropriate fire resistance duration as recommen ded in 
the table to clause 2.6.1.  
An unprotected area does not include a fixed unopenable window where the frame and 
glazing has the appropriate fire resistance duration. Any wallhead fascia, soffit or barge 
board, or any cavity vents or solum vents may al so be excluded from the unprotected area 
calculation (for external wall cladding see clause 2.6.4).  
Up to 500 mm from boundary -  where the external wall of a building is not more than 500 
mm from the boundary there should be no unprotected area, other than any wallhead 
fascia, soffit or barge board, or any cavity vents or solum vents.  
Up to 1 m from boundary -  where the external wall of a building is more than 500 mm but 
not more than 1 m from the boundary, the level of unprotected area is limited to:  
a. the external wall of a protected zone  
b. an area of not more than 0.1 m2, which are at least 1.5 m from any other unprotected 
area in the same wall  
c. an area of not more than 1 m2, which are at least 4m from any other unprotected area 
in the same wall (the 1 m2 unpr otected area may consist of two or more smaller areas 
which when combined do not exceed an aggregate area of 1 m2).  
2.6.3  The simple geometry method  
More than 1 m from boundary -  where the external wall of a building is more than 1 m 
from the boundary the amount of unprotected area (in square metres) may be equivalent 
to six times the distance (in metres) to the boundary. Therefore if the distance to the 
boundary is at least 1 m, the unprotected area should not exceed 6 m2, if the distance to 
the boundary i s at least 2 m, the unprotected area is 12 m2, and so on. 
Where the external wall of a building is more than 6 m from the boundary, the amount of 
unprotected area is unlimited.  
The use of the simple geometry method described above is limited to buildings w hich are 
more than 1 m from the boundary, not more than 9 m in height, and the length of the side 
of the building facing the boundary is not more than 24 m. Any external side of a building 
which makes an angle of more than 800 with the plane of reference c an be ignored in the 
calculation of unprotected area. The diagram below provides a typical example of a 
conservatory attached to a house.  
 
  
################# - Page 104 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 104 Applicable from 5  June 2023   Figure 2.3 Conservatory example  
 
Where a domestic building exceeds these limits, reference could be made to the Enclosing 
Rectangle Method (Table B) contained in the non- domestic guidance document or the 
Building Research Establishment Report 'External fire spread: building separation and 
boundary distances' (BR 187, 1991). In these cases, for the purpose of calculating the 
enclosing rectangle, a separating wall or separating floor should be regarded as a 
compartment wall or compartment floor.  
2.6.4  External wall  cladding 
External wall cladding may contribute to the radiant heat flux from a fire and should be 
considered when calculating the amount of unprotected area. Additional guidance on 
external wall cladding systems is provided in the guidance to Standards 2.2, 2.4, 2.7 and 
annex 2.B.  
All situations - The use of highly combustible metal composite material panels referred to 
and defined in Regulation 8 of the Building (Scotland) Amendment Regulations 2022 is 
prohibited.  
Not more than 1 m from a boundary -  External wall cladding not more than 1 m from a 
boundary should achieve a European Classification A1 or A2 and can be excluded from 
the calculation of unprotected area.  
More than 1 m from a boundary -  Fire within the building may break out through a 
window or door opening and as a consequence, the cladding, once ignited, would 
contribute to the heat generated from the fire. Therefore where the cladding is more than 1 
m from a boundary and is constructed from products more than 1 mm thick that has  
European Classification B, C, D or E (as described in annex 2.B), the cladding should be 
included in the calculation of unprotected area.  
Storey height 11 m or more above the ground -  Regardless of the distance from the 
boundary, any external wall cladding system attached to a domestic building with a storey 
height 11 m or more above the ground must be constructed from products which achieve 

################# - Page 105 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 105 Applicable from 5  June 2023   European Classification A1 or A2 (Also, see guidance to standards 2.2, 2.4, 2.7 and annex 
2.B).  
Houses - External wall cladding to a house (other than a house with a storey at a height 
of 11 m or more above the ground) need not achieve European Classification A1 or A2 
where the external wall has the appropriate fire resistance duration and the cladding 
achieves European Classification B. In such cases the cladding may be excluded from the 
unprotected area calculation regardless of openings . 
2.6.5  Combustibility  
Every part of an external wall including an external wall cladding system (see clause 2.7.1 
and annex 2.B) not more than 1 m from a boundary or the external wall of a high rise 
domestic building, should be constructed from products w hich achieve European 
Classification A1 or A2. This does not apply to insulation exposed in a cavity that is 
between two leaves of masonry or concrete where both leaves are at least 75 mm thick, 
and which has a cavity barrier around all openings in the wal l and at the top of the wall - 
head.  
However a structural frame and any thermal insulation material in the frame not more than 
1 m from a boundary may be constructed from combustible products provided:  
* no storey height is more than 18 m, and  
* the recommendat ions in clauses 2.6.1 and 2.6.2 have been followed, and  
* any external wall cladding system (see clauses 2.6.4, 2.7.1 and annex 2.B) is

See the guidance to Standards 2.2, 2.4 and 2.7 f or additional guidance in relation to 
cavities and external wall cladding systems.  
2.6.6  Supporting  structure  
Where an element of structure provides support to an external wall (including external wall 
cladding) which has a fire resistance duration (as rec ommended in the guidance to 
clauses 2.6.1 and 2.6.2) the supporting element of structure should also have at least the 
same fire resistance duration.

Mandatory Standard  
Standard 2.7  
Every building must be designed and constructed in such a way, having regard 
to the height, use and position of the building, that in the event of an outbreak of 
fire within the building, or from an external source, the spread of fire on the 
external walls of the building is inhibited.  
 
 
2.7.0  Introduction 
There is a risk of fire spread on the external walls of a building. Fire could break out 
through a window or door opening and spread onto the external walls. External walls close 
to the boundary are also at risk as they may be exposed to direc t flame impingement or 
radiant heat flux from a fire in an adjoining building or other external source.  
The use of highly combustible metal composite material panels referred to and defined in 
Regulation 8 of the Building (Scotland) Amendment Regulations 2022 is prohibited.  
Vertical and horizontal fire spread between dwellings should be inhibited by the 
construction of separating walls and floors and the provision of fire barriers and cavity 
barriers. See guidance to Standards 2.4 and 2.7.  
Fire-fighters may  not be able to apply a water jet from a fire- fighting hose directly onto a 
fire that has spread onto or within an external wall high above the ground. This is because 
the external wall is either inaccessible or is out with the reach capability of fire- fighting 
equipment. Therefore, the construction of external walls in taller buildings should not 
contribute to the development of fire or contribute to vertical fire spread up the facade of 
the building. The 11 m storey height in clause 2.7.1 and clause 2.7.2 is based on the reach 
capability of a fire and rescue service ground mounted water jet where there is sufficient 
pressure and flow in the water main. Designers are encouraged to seek early advice from 
the fire and rescue service if they wish to vary from the guidance where, for example, the 
facade is accessible to high reach appliances. Also, see Regulation 8 and annex 2.B for 
exceptions.  
The guidance for fire spread on external walls should not be assessed in isolation and 
reference should be made to the guidance to Standard 2.4 for fire spread in cavities and 
the guidance to Standard 2.6 for fire spread to neighbouring buildings.   
Green walls (also called living walls) have become popular in recent years. Best practice 
guidance can be found in 'Fire Perfo rmance of Green Roofs and Walls' published by the 
Department of Communities and Local Government."  
The Building Standards Futures Board has been established to improve the performance, 
expertise, resilience and sustainability of the Scottish building stand ards system. A key 
work stream currently under development is the creation of a Compliance Plan to ensure 
that designs, receiving a building warrant, are constructed in accordance with the building 
regulations and approved drawings. External wall cladding systems and specified 
################# - Page 107 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 107 Applicable from 5  June 2023   attachments are considered safety critical features. In the interim, documented evidence of 
proof of compliance should be submitted to the local authority verifier which demonstrates 
that the system as approved has been constructed in accordance with the building 
warrant.  
Conversions - in the case of conversions, as specified in regulation 4, the building as 
converted shall meet the requirements of this standard in so far as is reasonably 
practicable, and in no case be worse than befor e the conversion (regulation 12, schedule 
6). 
2.7.1  External wall cladding  systems  
External wall cladding systems attached to a domestic building or sheltered housing 
complex having any storey at a height of more than 11 m above the ground, must be 
constru cted of products which achieve European Classification A1 or A2, subject to some 
limited exceptions (see Regulation 8 and annex 2.B).  
External wall cladding systems -  means non load -bearing components attached to  the 
buildings structure, for example, composite panels, clay or concrete tiles, slates,  pre-cast 
concrete panels, stone panels, masonry, profiled metal sheeting including sandwich 
panels, rendered external thermally insulated cladding systems, glazing systems, timber 
panels, weather boarding and ventilated cladding systems. For the purposes of 
compliance with the building regulations and associated standards, external wall cladding 
systems also include spandrel panels and infill panels. Many systems incorporate support 
rails, fixings,  thermal insulation, fire barriers and cavity barriers located behind the outer 
cladding.  
Sheathing or backing board -  attached to and providing structural support to the frame is 
not considered to form part of the external wall cladding system. However, w here 
combustible sheathing or backing board is proposed in any building with a storey 11 m or 
more above the ground, a large scale facade fire test should be carried out (see annex 
2.B).  
Service penetrations - service penetrations such as flues, pipes, duc ts or cables are not 
considered to be components forming part of an external wall cladding system.  
All situations -  the use of highly combustible metal composite material panels referred to 
and defined in Regulation 8 of the Building (Scotland) Amendment R egulations 2022 is 
prohibited.  
External wall cladding more than 1 m from a boundary may be constructed from 
combustible products which achieve European Classifications B, C, D or E. This guidance 
does not apply to domestic buildings having a storey at a height 11 m or more above the 
ground (see Regulation 8 and annex 2.B).  
External wall cladding not more than 1  m from a boundary should achieve European 
Classification A1 or A2 except cladding to a house where : 
* the cladding achieves a European Classification B,  
* the wall behind the cladding has the appropriate fire resistance duration from both 
sides, and 
* the topmost storey is less than 11 m above the ground.

Page 108 Applicable from 5  June 2023   2.7.2  Specified  attachments  
There is a risk of vertical fire spread from specified attachments to an ex ternal wall 
including balconies, solar panels and solar shading. Fire- fighters may not be able to apply 
a water jet from a fire -fighting hose directly onto a fire that has spread onto specified 
attachments high above the ground.  
Where a relevant building h as a storey at a height of 11 m or more above the ground, 
specified attachments must be constructed of products achieving European Classification 
A1 or A2.  
Where a building (other than a relevant building) has a storey at a height of 11 m or more 
above the ground, specified attachments should also be constructed of products achieving 
European Classification A1 or A2.  
Extendable and retractable solar shading products such as awnings and canopies are not 
considered to be fixed solar shading attachments within the context of Regulation 8.  
However, awnings and canopies should still be considered on a risk based approach to 
assess the potential for vertical fire spread in accordance with Standard 2.7. For example, 
multiple canopies vertically aligned on every storey of a building having a storey at a 
height of 11 m or more above the ground possess a much greater risk of vertical fire 
spread compared with an awning or canopy located on the ground or basement storey 
only.  
Signage is not considered to form part of an external wall cladding system or specified 
attachment.

Mandatory Standard  
Standard 2.8  
Every building must be designed and constructed in such a way that in the 
event of an outbreak of fire in a neighbour ing building, the spread of fire to the 
building is inhibited.  
 
 
2.8.0  Introduction 
Buildings are at risk from fires starting beyond their boundaries. The area of greatest 
vulnerability is the roof and there may be a risk of ignition or penetration by burning 
brands, flames or heat. The degree of protection for roof coverings is dependent upon the 
distance to the boundary.  
A roof covering consists of one or more layer of material such as felt, tiles, slates, 
sandwich panels etc., but is not intended to incl ude the whole of the roof structure. Solar 
roof panels should be regarded as forming part of the roof covering and as such should be 
able to resist ignition from an external source. Most solar panels are glazed and their 
ability to inhibit fire spread can be determined by the thickness of glass which makes up 
the panel (see table to annex 2.C).  
A roof covering or roof light which forms part of an internal ceiling lining should also follow 
the guidance to Standard 2.5 Internal linings.  
Green roofs have becom e popular in recent years. Best practice guidance can be found in 
'Fire Performance of Green Roofs and Walls' published by the Department of 
Communities and Local Government.  
Conversions - in the case of conversions, as specified in regulation 4, the building as 
converted shall meet the requirements of this standard in so far as is reasonably 
practicable, and in no case be worse than before the conversion (regulation 12, schedule 
6). 
2.8.1  Roof  coverings  
The possibility of direct flame impingement from neighbouring buildings is greater where 
the roof covering of the building is close to the boundary. Whilst much will depend on the 
fire dynamics and the velocity and direction of the wind, burning brands are also likely to 
be more intense. For these reasons, t he vulnerability of a roof covering is determined in 
relation to the distance of a building to the boundary.  
Not more that 6 m from boundary -  the roof of a building, including any rooflights, but 
excluding any wallhead fascia, flashing or trim, boxed gutt ers, soffit or barge boards, 
should have a low vulnerability if not more than 6 m from the boundary. Common materials 
that normally attain the criterion include, slates, tiles, glazing, sandwich panels and certain 
plastic materials as described the table t o annex 2.C.

barge boards, should have a low or a medium vulnerability if more than 6 m but not more 
than 24 m from the boundary. Common materials that normally attain the criterion include 
felts and certain plastic materials as described in the table to annex 2.C.  
More than 24 m from boundary -  where a building is more than 24 m from the boundary, 
the roof may be of any material, including materials of high vulnerability classification.

Page 111 Applicable from 5  June 2023   2.9 Escape  
Mandatory Standard  
Standard 2.9  
Every building must be designed and constructed in such a way that in the 
event of an outbreak of fire within the building, the occupants, once alerted to 
the outbreak of the fire, are provided with the opportunity to escape from the 
building, before being affected by fire or smoke.  
 
 
2.9.0  Introduction 
If a fire starts in a dwelling, occupants within the dwelling of fire origin should be provided 
with at least one route of escape through an exit door which leads to a place of safety 
outside the building. Occupants in dwellings may not be aware of the speed that fire can 
spread and if they are asleep are more likely to delay their escape. Therefore, it is 
important that a fire alarm is installed to provide occupants with early warning of fire (see 
Standard 2.11). In some cases, a fire alarm alone may not be sufficient and a protected 
route wi thin the dwelling may be necessary due to the height that occupants are located 
above the ground. Occupants in dwellings located near the ground have the added benefit 
of access to windows to escape in an emergency.  
Once outside flats or maisonettes, occup ants may still need to escape through common 
areas within the building to reach a place of safety. This is termed an 'escape route'. The 
building should be designed to inhibit fire and smoke spread into the escape route. Where 
occupants have only one means  of escape from the building, automatic smoke ventilation 
is normally provided to help remove any smoke and heat that may enter the escape route.  
Following the outbreak of fire anywhere in the building, there may be residents located in 
common lounges, com munal laundry rooms and solid waste storage rooms. Service 
engineers may also be working in service spaces, plant rooms and lift machine rooms for 
example. These occupants should also be provided with the opportunity to escape from 
the building following a  fire. The non- domestic Technical Handbook should be used for 
guidance on travel distances within ancillary rooms and for escape routes serving such 
rooms.  
In flatted accommodation, it is common practice for the fire and rescue service to intervene 
and com mence fire- fighting and rescue operations before all occupants have made their 
escape to a place of safety. However compliance with Standard 2.9 should reduce the risk 
of occupants becoming trapped by fire and smoke.  
If a fire has accidentally or deliberat ely been set in the common stair, the escape route 
may become impassable. In such cases occupants should be able to remain safely inside 
the building until the fire has burnt itself out or until the fire has been contained and it is 
safe to use the escape route.  
Fire protection measures used to protect routes of escape and to provide a safe refuge 
include a combination of passive and active protection. Walls, floors, and doors can 
provide good passive fire protection. Active systems such as automatic detect ion, 
################# - Page 112 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 112 Applicable from 5  June 2023   automatic smoke ventilation and automatic suppression are designed to activate in the 
earlier stages of fire development to provide early warning, control heat and smoke and 
inhibit fire growth. All escape strategies incorporate a combination of passi ve and active 
fire protection measures.  
Exclusions and obstacles to escape -  a lift should not be used for escape because there 
is a risk that the lift could malfunction during the outbreak of fire. Fire- fighters may use a 
fire-fighting lift to rescue injured occupants but this is matter for the fire and rescue service 
to decide, following a risk assessment at the incident.  
Fixed ladders are considered to be too dangerous for residents to use for escape however 
a fixed ladder may be used from a lift machine room or a plant room provided it is not a 
place of special fire risk. These rooms will only be used intermittently by engineers who 
are likely to be familiar with and trained in the use of fixed ladders.  
Locking devices on final exit doors and on escape w indows should not prevent occupants 
escaping from the building. The intention is to assist escape, but not to exclude the use of 
locks or other safety devices (see Section 4 Safety). Permanent obstructions such as fixed 
security grills should not be used on final exit doors or escape windows.  
Conversions - in the case of conversions, as specified in regulation 4, the building as 
converted shall meet the requirement of this standard (regulation 12, schedule 6).  
2.9.1  Escape within dwellings -  general  principles  
The time occupants need to escape varies enormously and is dependent on a number of 
risk factors including, early warning of fire, the occupant characteristics, the number of exit 
doors, the area of an individual storey within a dwelling, the height of  the topmost storey 
above the ground or depth of the storey below ground.  
Early warning of fire is one of the key fire safety measures to provide occupants with 
sufficient time to escape from the building before being overcome from the effects of fire 
and smoke. Sleeping occupants will react more slowly and it is important that they  
receive the earliest possible warning of the outbreak of fire within the dwelling. Guidance 
to Standard 2.11 provides recommendations for the installation of fire detection and alarm 
systems in domestic buildings.  
The occupant characteristics in dwellings are wide ranging and therefore impossible to 
quantify in building standards. The guidance in the Handbooks assumes that the 
occupants are capable of moving or being moved to a place of safety. For dwellings that 
require to be licensed as a house in multiple occupation, or where a care service is 
provided for the occupants, additional fire protection measures may be required to satisfy 
other legislation (see 2.0 Introduction).  
The number of exit doors from a dwelling is important. If every floor in every dwelling has 
2 or more exit doors which lead to a place of safety, the risk that occupants could  become 
trapped by fire and smoke would be low and the fire protection measures would be 
minimal. However this is not practical to achieve in the majority of cases and as a result, 
the guidance recommends that every dwelling should be provided with at least 1 exit  door.  
The area of an individual storey within a dwelling has an impact on the time occupants 
have available for escape from a fire originating in the dwelling. A dwelling with an 
individual storey more than 200 m2 is outside the scope of the guidance (see 2.0 
Introduction). In such cases, an alternative approach (see clause 2.0. 8) based on the 
################# - Page 113 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 113 Applicable from 5  June 2023   guidance contained in this handbook may be appropriate but the need for additional exits 
and additional fire protection measures would need to be considered on a case by case 
basis.  
Height of storey above ground -  increased height brings ex tra risk, both in the time 
needed for escape and the difficulties posed to the fire and rescue service in attempting to 
assist evacuation, effect rescue or fight fires. Therefore, the fire protection measures 
increase with the storey height of the building . 
Dwellings on sloping sites may have certain rooms located deeper below or higher above 
the adjacent ground level than other rooms. In such cases, the storey depth below the 
adjacent ground or storey height above the adjacent ground from each room may be 
assessed individually and the guidance followed accordingly.  
The scope of the guidance is limited to those storeys at a depth of not more than 4.5 m 
below the adjacent ground level and to those buildings with no storey at a height of more 
than 60 m (approximately 20 storeys) above the adjacent ground (see 2.0 Introduction).  
2.9.2  Escape within dwellings -  options  
In the event of an outbreak of fire, every dwelling should be provided with at least one 
route of escape through an exit door which leads ultim ately to a place of safety. The route 
within a dwelling will normally comprise a combination of rooms and circulation spaces.  
Where the dwelling has more than one storey such as houses and maisonettes, the 
occupants may be located on a storey where their only means of escape is by way of a 
private stair towards the floor of fire origin. The occupants would then need to negotiate 
the fire floor before reaching the exit door from the dwelling and therefore the guidance 
recognises the increased risk in multi -storey dwellings.  
The following table summarises the recommendations for escape within dwellings. For 
example, a typical 2 storey house would normally have a topmost storey not more than 4.5 
m and from the following table should be provided with at least one route of escape 
through an exit door, early warning (smoke and heat alarms) and escape windows.

2.9.3  Escape within dwellings -  basement  storeys  
A basement storey may have no windows or a limited number of ventilators which can 
cause a significant build up of heat and smoke. The fire may become suppressed as the 
oxygen is depleted however if the door to the basement storey (or room of fire origin) is 
opened, the sudden intake of air together with the release of hot fire gases can cause an 
explosive event known as a backdraught. This rapid fire spread places occupants on the 
ground or upper storeys at greater risk. Therefore, the private stair serving the basement 
storey should be separated at the ground storey by construction having a short fire 
resistance duration.  
There is a risk that occupants in a basement storey could become trapped following the 
outbreak of fire. This is because windows are oft en positioned too high above the floor 
level to access with ease or they may lead to an enclosed space below the adjoining 
ground level from which there is no escape. Therefore, an alternative exit (see clause 
2.9.6) should be provided from the basement st orey unless escape windows are provided 
from every basement apartment.  
2.9.4  Escape within dwellings -  escape  windows  
Occupants in a basement storey or in an upper storey at a height of not more than 4.5 m 
may have access to escape windows. The use of windows for escape should only ever be 
considered in an emergency situation as a last resort and should not form part of the 
principal route of escape. Where occupants are trapped on upper storeys, they can use 
the window to call for assistance or to supply fr esh air whilst awaiting rescue. If conditions 
within the room become untenable, the occupant can use the window to escape and lower 
themselves to the adjoining ground. This inevitably involves some degree of risk and 
################# - Page 118 -  ##################

Page 118 Applicable from 5  June 2023   windows in a storey at a height of more  than 4.5 m are considered to be too high above 
the adjacent ground from which to escape. Therefore, an escape window should be 
provided in every apartment on an upper storey at a height of not more than 4.5 m above 
the adjacent ground. However this is not  necessary where there is an alternative route of 
escape from the apartment to other circulation spaces or to other rooms.  
Occupants within an inner room can become trapped where there is an outbreak of fire in 
the adjoining access room. Therefore, every i nner room on a storey at a height of not more 
than 4.5 m above the adjacent ground level should be provided with an escape window 
unless the inner room has an alternative route of escape.  
Escape windows should be large enough to escape through and should be situated in an 
external wall or roof. The windows should have an unobstructed openable area that is at 
least 0.33 m2 and at least 450 mm high and 450 mm wide. The route through the window 
may be at an angle rather than straight through and the bottom of the openable area 
should be not more than 1100 mm above the floor.  
Conservatories - the location of conservatories also presents some difficulties in relation 
to escape windows. Where a conservatory is located below an escape window 
consideration should be given to the design of the conservatory roof to withstand the loads 
exerted from occupants lowering themselves onto the roof in the event of a fire. However 
the choice to construct a more robust roof and frame is a matter of preference and the 
decision to do this should remain with the owner.  
2.9.5  Escape within dwellings -  protected enclosure  
Occupants in apartments (e.g. lounges, bedrooms etc) may be asleep during the outbreak 
of fire. Where they are located on an upper storey and it is not practical to provide an 
escape window due to the height above the adjacent ground there is a greater risk of 
becoming trapped by fire and smoke. For this option (see tables to clause 2.9.2), every 
apartment on a storey at a height of more than 4.5 m above the adjacent ground should 
provide direct access to a protected enclosure which leads to an exit door.  
Protected enclosures should be designed and constructed to withstand fire in an adjoining 
room or space. The protected enclosure should form a complete enclosure having a short 
fire resistance duration. Every door in the wall of a protected enclosure (other than a door 
serving sanitary accommodation) should be a self -closing fire door with a short fire 
resistance duration. A cupboard door need not be self -closing unless there is an ignition 
source within the cupboard such as an electrical distribution board or a boiler.  
2.9.6  Escape within dwellings -  alternative  exits  
For this option (see table to clause 2.9.2), eve ry upper storey in a house or maisonette at a 
height of more than 7.5 m above the adjacent ground should be provided with an 
alternative exit. The intention is to reduce the risk that occupants could become trapped 
within their own dwelling and provide the m with the opportunity to turn away from the fire 
on the floor of fire origin and make their escape in the other direction. Where the second 
route of escape is by way of another private stair, the stair should be enclosed in a 
protected enclosure which lea ds to an alternative exit.

Page 119 Applicable from 5  June 2023   2.9.7  Escape within dwellings -  open plan option with suppression 
and enhanced early warning 
Open plan layouts are becoming more popular with modern living styles. For this option 
(see tables to clause 2.9.2), the following guidance should be followed for open plan 
layouts provided the kitchen is remote from the exit door.  
Where the topmost storey height is more than 4.5 m above the adjoining ground an 
automatic life safety fire suppression system and an enhanced early warning sys tem 
should be installed to protect the occupants. In a slower developing fire, the early warning 
system should provide the occupants with sufficient time to escape and in those cases 
where the fire develops quickly, the suppression system should control the fire giving the 
occupants the opportunity to escape.  
The automatic life safety fire suppression system should be designed and installed in 
accordance with BS 9251: 2014.  
The enhanced early warning system should follow the guidance in BS 5839: Part 6: 2019 
for a grade D, category LD1 system. Where this option is adopted in sheltered housing 
complexes, a grade C system should be installed (see Standard 2.11).  
2.9.8  Escape within dwellings -  ducted heating and ventilation  
systems  
Ducted heating or ventilation systems should not transfer fire and smoke from the room of 
fire origin to the remainder of the dwelling. Therefore, where a dwelling has a basement 
storey or a storey at a height of more than 4.5 m and is provided with a system of ducts 
that connect rooms and circulation spaces:  
* transfer grilles should not be fitted between any room and the protected enclosure, 
and 
* supply and return grilles should be not more than 450 mm above floor level, and  
* where warm air is ducted to a protected enclosure, the return air should be ducted 
back to the heater, and  
* where a duct passes through any wall, floor, or ceiling of a protected enclosure, all 
joints between the duct and the surrounding construction should be fire stopped, and  
* there should be a room thermostat in the living room, at a height more than 1370 mm 
and not more than 1830 mm, with an automatic control which will turn off the heater, 
and actuate any circulation fan should the ambient temperature rise to more than      
35 degC, and  
* where the system recirculates  air, smoke detectors should be installed within the duct 
to cause the recirculation of air to stop and direct all extract air to the outside of the 
building in the event of fire.  
Fire dampers should be installed where the ducts pass through fire resisting construction 
or alternatively fire resisting ductwork should be provided. In either case, the fire 
resistance duration of the construction should be maintained.

Page 120 Applicable from 5  June 2023   2.9.9  Escape routes - general  principles  
Once occupants have left the flat, maisonette or any other ancillary room or space, they 
should be protected from fire and smoke to allow them sufficient time to escape from the 
building in relative safety. Those occupants who are remote from the fire are more likely to 
be unaware of the outbreak and may delay their evacuation. People also move more 
slowly on stairs than they do on the level and will take longer to evacuate tall buildings with 
many flights of stairs.  
The fire dynamics can be significantly different in tall buildings. The effect of the wind may 
be greater which could accelerate the speed, direction and intensity of the fire. For 
example, if a window is open or breaks under fire conditions or the door to the dwelling of 
fire origin is opened, the wind could accelerate fire growth to such an ex tent that the entire 
flat or maisonette becomes fully involved in the fire. The wind direction might also induce 
cross flows of fire and smoke that could endanger fire- fighters entering the dwelling and 
any occupants attempting to escape from adjoining dwellings.  
A further risk in high rise domestic buildings is the loss of smoke buoyancy in tall shafts 
such as stairs which may cause stratification of smoke before it reaches the smoke 
ventilator at the top of the stairwell. Fire and rescue service equipment  has a reach 
capability of 30 m but may not have access to all elevations of the building (See guidance 
to Standard 2.14). Therefore, in order to improve redundancy and escape route options in 
tall buildings, at least two escape stairs should be provided t o every domestic building with 
a storey height more than 18 m above the ground level.  
2.9.10  Escape routes - options  
The guidance assumes that in most cases, a fire will start inside a dwelling or other 
ancillary room or space within the building. Therefore, at least one escape route should be 
provided from every flat, maisonette and from the following ancillary rooms or spaces 
serving a domestic building:  
* communal room e.g. a communal lounge or laundry in a sheltered housing complex  
* plant room  
* solid waste storage room  
* store room  
* lift machine room, and  
* accessible service duct or  cupboard.  
The above list is not intended to be comprehensive and any other room or space should 
be provided with at least one escape route. The non- domestic Technical Handbook should 
be used for guidance on travel distances within ancillary rooms and escape routes serving 
such rooms. A parking garage is a non- domestic building but may be mixed use, see 
clause 2.9.17.  
There are many options available to designers when consideri ng escape routes in 
buildings containing flats and maisonettes. These options can be subdivided into 2 broad 
categories:  
* internal escape routes e.g. protected corridors and protected stairs,  and 
################# - Page 121 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 121 Applicable from 5  June 2023   * external escape routes e.g. protected balconies or protected external escape stairs.  
Standard 2.15 requires an automatic fire suppression system to be installed within flats 
and maisonettes and social housing dwellings. In certain circumstances (see table 2.4), 
there is no need to provide protected lobbies (see clause 2.9.13) between the dwellings 
and the escape stair. However there is a risk that the fire protection measures may not be 
maintained by the occupants of the building and as a result, the number of dwellings 
should be limited to 4 dwellings per storey and no storey is at a height of more than 7.5 m 
above the adjacent ground level. The intention is to limit the size and height of a domestic 
building where some reliance is placed on fire precautions within a dwelling that also 
protects the common escape rout e. 
Escape routes in common areas should be sterile areas. The limitation on travel distance 
within protected lobbies is intended to reduce the time it takes occupants to escape and to 
reduce their potential exposure to smoke following an outbreak of fire i n the building.  
Automatic smoke ventilation should be provided within every protected lobby serving a 
single escape stair in a domestic building to improve tenability conditions within the escape 
route. More detailed guidance can be found in the BS EN 1210 1 series of standards.  
The following table summarises the recommendations when designing buildings 
containing flats and maisonettes(including social housing dwellings) and any ancillary 
rooms.

dwellings) and any ancillary rooms

Page 124 Applicable from 5  June 2023   2.9.11  Escape routes - basement  storeys  
A basement storey with insufficient ventilation can cause a significant build up of heat and 
smoke. If the door to the basement storey is opened, the sudden intake of air together with 
the release of hot fire gases can cause an explosive event known as a backdraught which 
can create signific ant flaming through the door opening. There is also a risk that 
disoriented occupants could continue their escape to the basement storey instead of 
escaping through the ground storey. In order to minimise these risks, a medium duration 
fire resisting wall or screen (including a self -closing fire door) should be provided in the 
protected zone at the ground storey to separate the basement storey from the remainder 
of the protected zone.  
2.9.12  Escape routes - protected  zones  
Protected zones are intended to pr ovide a place of relative safety inside the building. 
Occupants using the escape stair should be safe from the effects of fire and smoke during 
their evacuation to a place of safety. The enclosing structure of a protected zone should 
have at least a medium  fire resistance duration. In the case of a high rise domestic 
buildings the protected zone should have a long fire resistance duration.  Self-closing fire 
doors in the enclosing structure of a protected zone need only achieve a short fire 
resistance durati on and in the case of a high rise domestic building, a medium fire 
resistance duration.  
External walls adjacent to protected zones -  if a protected zone has an external wall 
that projects beyond the face of a building or is set back in a recess, the protec ted zone 
may be vulnerable if fire breaks out through an adjacent window, door or other opening. 
Radiated heat or flames from the fire may impede occupants using the protected zone to 
escape.  
Therefore, where any part of an external wall of a protected zone is not more than 2 m 
from, and makes an angle of not more than 135 degrees with any part of an external wall 
in another part of the building, the protected zone should be protected against fire for a 
distance of 2 m by construction which provides a mediu m fire resistance duration. The 
designer can choose which wall should be fire resisting and may include fire resisting 
facades or other fixed glazing or any other opening protected against fire. However it is not 
sufficient to use the final exit door as a barrier between the occupants escaping and the 
fire. In such cases, the external wall adjoining the protected zone at the final exit should be 
protected against fire as described above.  
2.9.13  Escape routes - protected  lobbies  
A protected lobby is located within a protected zone and is designed to inhibit the 
movement of fire and smoke from an adjoining room, storey or space into the escape stair 
or fire -fighting lobby. This is normally achieved by fire resisting construction together with 
at least 2 sets of self -closing fire doors between the fire and the escape stair or fire- fighting 
lobby. The wall between the protected lobby or fire- fighting lobby and the escape stair 
should have a short fire resistance duration and any door in the wall should be a self - 
closing fire door with short fire resistance duration. For high rise domestic buildings the 
wall between the escape stair and the protected lobby should have a medium fire 
resistance duration and any self -closing fire door should have a short fire resista nce 
duration. See guidance to Standard 2.14 for fire- fighting facilities.  
################# - Page 125 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 125 Applicable from 5  June 2023   Protected lobbies in domestic buildings are used:  
* to inhibit fire and smoke spread to escape  stairs  
* to help evacuees escape from the floor of fire origin  
* to provide protection and space for the fire and rescue service to set up a forward 
control point (see Standard 2.14), and  
* to provide a bridgehead from which to commence fire fighting and rescue operations 
(see Standard 2.14).  
In order to inhibit fire and smoke spread to the escape stair and to help evacuees on the 
floor of fire origin reach the escape stair, automatic smoke ventilation should be provided 
and travel distance within the lobby is limited to 10 m. Where flats or maisonettes are 
accessed from a n open access balcony, there is no need to provide a protected lobby.  
Protected lobbies should be designed that smoke entering one protected lobby should not 
spread to other protected lobbies. There should be no inter -connection between protected 
lobbies other than:  
* the escape stair  
* a smoke ventilation shaft  
* protected services  
* fire mains, or  
* passenger lift or fire- fighting lift.  
Any gaps or imperfections of fit should be fire -stopped.  
2.9.14   Escape routes - smoke  ventilation 
Although there are physical bar riers to fire such as walls, floors and doors, there is still a 
risk of smoke spread into escape routes. Therefore, smoke ventilation should be provided 
in protected lobbies, fire- fighting lobbies and protected corridors in certain circumstances 
(see Table 2.4) to help maintain tenable conditions within escape routes.  
The fire and rescue service will normally be in attendance before all flats or maisonettes 
have been evacuated. Therefore, it is important that the smoke ventilators (including 
powered systems ) are capable of being opened, closed or shut off by fire and rescue 
personnel to assist them with their fire- fighting and rescue operations (see Standard 2.14).  
Smoke ventilation of escape routes can be provided by:  
* natural smoke ventilation, or  
* mechanical smoke ventilation.  
The merits and limitations of each system should be assessed by the designer before 
deciding which system to choose.  
More detailed guidance can be found in the BS EN 12101 series of standards.

Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 126 Applicable from 5  June 2023   2.9.15  Escape routes - natural smoke  ventilation  
Natural ventilation uses external openings in the roof or walls of the building to remove 
smoke using its own buoyancy. The efficiency of a natural smoke ventilation system 
depends upon the location of the ventilator and the direction and velocity  of the prevailing 
wind. Under certain conditions, the smoke flow through ventilators may be enhanced whilst 
under other conditions, it may be impaired. Ideally the location of ventilators should be 
positioned on the building in negative pressure zones and inlets in positive pressure zones 
however this is difficult to achieve for all wind directions. Natural smoke ventilation can be 
provided by either:  
* automatic opening external wall ventilators, or  
* smoke shafts.  
Automatic opening external wall ventilators -  every protected lobby should be provided 
with natural smoke vents on an external wall which have an area of at least 1.5 m2  that 
discharges smoke direct to the external air. The ventilators should be actuated 
automatically by means of smoke detectors in the common space.  
A natural smoke shaft uses the natural buoyancy of the smoke together with the effect of 
the wind passing over the top of the shaft to help draw the smoke through the shaft to the 
outside air. The design of natural smoke shafts is based on a fire providing a  heat output 
of not more than 2.5 megawatts through an open door of 780 mm wide. This scenario 
simulates a fully developed (flashover) fire condition in a room within the flat or maisonette. 
Where the fire produces cooler smoke (e.g. a smouldering fire), the smoke might not 
escape so readily when subject to adverse wind or stack effects. The inlet/outlet 
configuration will vary depending wind direction and designers should take this into 
account. For example, a vent cowl could be installed on the top of the smoke shaft to help 
draw the smoke out of the shaft for all wind directions. The full research report 'Smoke 
ventilation of common access areas of flats and maisonettes (BD 2410) -  Final Factual 
Report (BRE, 2005)' can be accessed on  the BRE website http://www.bre.co.uk/.  
The shaft should be closed at the base and replacement air is provided from the automatic 
opening ventilator in the adjacent stairwell to help the efficiency of the shaft system. The 
smoke shaft should have:  
* a minimum cross -sectional area 1.5 m2 (minimum dimension 0.85 m in any direction), 
opening at roof level at least 0.5 m above any surrounding structures within a 
horizontal distance of 2.0 m, and  
* the minimum area of the ventilator from the protected lobby in to the shaft and at the 
opening at the head of the shaft and at all internal locations within the shaft (e.g. safety 
grilles) should be at least 1 m2, and 
* the smoke shaft should have at least a medium fire resistance duration and all 
ventilators should hav e a short fire resistance duration,  and 
* the shaft should be vertical from base to head but may have not more than 4 m at an 
inclined angle not more than 30o from the vertical plane,  and 
* on detection of smoke in the protected lobby, the ventilator on the fi re floor, the 
ventilator at the top of the smoke shaft and the 1 m2 ventilator at the head of the 
stairway should  all open simultaneously. The ventilators from the protected lobbies on 
all other storeys should remain closed.

Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 127 Applicable from 5  June 2023   2.9.16  Escape routes - mechani cal smoke  ventilation 
Mechanical smoke ventilation using pressure differentials may be used to inhibit smoke 
spread into escape routes by means of:  
* depressurisation systems, or  
* pressurisation systems, or  
* heating and ventilation systems.  
A depressurisation system is based on the principle of extracting smoke to the outside 
air. This creates a negative pressure in the space relative to the adjacent spaces. Where a 
smoke ventilation depressurisation system is used, replacement air should be provided for 
the sy stem to operate effectively. The volume of air and smoke removed should be 
replaced with the equivalent volume of replacement air at a sufficient rate in order to 
ensure a smoke flow out of the building. Reducing the rate of replacement air can result in 
the smoke ventilation system becoming less efficient whereas increasing replacement air 
and extraction at high velocities can produce air pressure conditions which make doors 
difficult to open. The system should be balanced to ensure that the forces required to open 
doors are not greater than those specified in Section 4 Safety.  
A pressurisation system is based on the principle of forcing air into the escape route 
which helps to keep smoke out. Forced air can be used to maintain a positive pressure in 
the es cape route which produces an air flow through gaps around doors preventing the 
smoke from entering. The system design should take account of likely pressure reduction 
when occupants open doors to escape or when fire- fighters open doors to access the fire. 
The system should be balanced to ensure that the forces required to open doors are not 
greater than those specified in Section 4 Safety.  
Ducted heating and/or ventilation systems, including air conditioning systems, that 
serve all dwellings in the building should not transfer fire and smoke to or from any 
dwelling to any other dwelling, common space, roof space or concealed space. Fire 
dampers should be installed where ducts pass through fire resisting construction unless 
the ducts have a medium fire resist ance duration or in the case of a high rise domestic 
building, the ducts have a long fire resistance  duration.  
The system installed to maintain interior environment conditions in a building should not 
compromise the function of the mechanical smoke ventilation system. Therefore, in the 
event of an outbreak of fire, the system should automatically either shut off or its function 
integrated with any smoke ventilation system that serves the escape routes. For more 
detailed guidance refer to BS 5588: Part 9: 19 99. 
2.9.17  Escape routes - mixed use buildings  
In a mixed use building the fire in the non- domestic part of the buildings could remain 
undetected for some time and reach a severe intensity (due to fire load) before the 
occupants in the flats or maisonettes  get warning. Therefore, where a protected zone is 
shared with a non- domestic building, a protected lobby should be provided between the 
non-domestic building and the escape stair to provide additional time for the residential 
occupants to escape. For addi tional guidance on protected lobbies including ventilation, 
see clauses 2.9.13 -  2.9.16 and clause 2.9.24.  
################# - Page 128 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 128 Applicable from 5  June 2023   Where flats or maisonettes have only one escape route and share a protected zone with a 
non-domestic building, the height of the topmost storey of the domestic building should be 
limited to 7.5 m to reduce the number of occupants who might be affected by a fire 
originating in the non- domestic building.  
2.9.18  Escape routes - fire hazard rooms and  services  
Fire hazard rooms and services can present a po tential source of fire ignition and fire 
spread into common escape routes.  
The following fire hazard rooms and service spaces adjacent to escape routes should be 
separated from the escape route by a construction that provides a medium fire resistance 
durat ion: 
* communal room e.g. a communal lounge or laundry in a sheltered housing  complex  
* plant room  
* solid waste storage room  
* store room  
* lift machine room, and  
* service duct or  cupboard.  
Even if the room does not contain an ignition source, the potential for a fi re to be set 
accidentally or deliberately should be assessed. For example, the door to a solid waste 
storage room might be left unlocked. For this reason, any door accessing a fire hazard 
room should be a self -closing fire door with a short fire resistance  duration. A fire door to a 
service duct or service cupboard should be locked to prevent unauthorised entry therefore 
does not need to be fitted with a self -closing device.  
Fuel pipes conveying fuel inside protected zones and protected lobbies could accelerate 
fire growth and under certain conditions, create an explosive atmosphere within the 
building. Oil and liquefied petroleum gas can produce pool fires (i.e. a turbulent fire burning 
above a horizontal pool of vaporising hydrocarbon fuel). The pool  fire can either be static, 
where the pool is contained, or a 'running' pool.  
Fuel pipes carrying oil (other than a pipe conveying oil supplying a hydraulic lift) should be 
located outside protected zones and protected lobbies.  
Fuel pipes carrying natural gas or liquefied petroleum gas (including associated meters) 
may be located inside protected zones or protected lobbies provided:  
* the installation is in accordance with the requirements of the Pipelines Safety 
Regulations 1996, SI 1996 No 825 and the Gas S afety (Installation and Use) 
Regulations 1998 SI 1998 No 2451, and  
* any pipe in a protected zones is constructed of screwed steel or welded steel 
construction,  and 
* the pipe or pipes are contained within a service shaft having a medium fire resistance 
durati on, and 
* the service shaft is ventilated at high and low level in accordance with BS 8313: 1997.

Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 129 Applicable from 5  June 2023   2.9.19  Escape routes - construction of escape  stairs 
Escape stairs should be protected from the outbreak of fire to allow occupants to escape 
and fire- fighters to access the fire. Therefore, every part of an escape stair (including 
landings) and the floor of a protected zone (including the floor of protected lobbies), should 
be constructed of products which achieve European Classification A1 or A2.  
However this does not apply to:  
* the floor of the lowest storey of the building  
* any handrail, balustrade or protective barrier on an escape stair, or  
* a floor finish (e.g. laminate flooring) applied to the escape stair (including landings) or 
to the floor of a protected z one or protected lobby.  
2.9.20  Escape routes - openings  
Fire and smoke can easily pass through openings in escape routes which could prevent 
the occupants from escaping in the event of an outbreak of fire within the building. For this 
reason, the openings should be designed to inhibit the spread of fire and smoke into the 
escape route. Where fire shutters or dampers are installed as part of a ducted system, 
they should be activated by localised smoke detectors.  
 
In order to inhibit the spread of fire and smoke, openings in separating walls and floors and 
openings in protected routes of escape should be protected and fire -stopped in 
accordance with the guidance to Standard 2.2.  
2.9.21  Escape routes - junctions  
The junctions between escape routes and other parts of the building are vulnerable to fire 
and smoke. Thi s is because fire and smoke can penetrate weaknesses at junctions which 
could compromise the escape route. The designer should consider detailing at junctions to 
inhibit fire and smoke spread into escape routes.  
In order to inhibit the spread of fire and s moke, junctions in separating walls and floors and 
junctions in protected routes of escape should be protected and fire -stopped in 
accordance with the guidance to Standard 2.2.  
2.9.22  Escape routes - external escape routes and escape  stairs 
Protection of e xternal routes of escape -  escape routes will normally lead to the final 
exit door of the building, which leads to a safe place in the outside air from which 
occupants can freely disperse. An exit can also lead to an external escape stair giving 
access to a place of  safety.  
In some cases it may not be possible to freely disperse away from the building (e.g. where 
the final exit door discharges to an enclosed outdoor space). In such cases, where there is 
only 1 route of escape, the external wall of the building within 2 m of the route of escape 
should have a short fire resistance duration for integrity up to 1.1 m above the adjoining 
ground. This does not apply to sub- floor vents.  
An external escape stair is an unenclosed escape stair which is open to the ext ernal air 
and provides occupants with an escape route which leads to a place of safety. External

Page 130 Applicable from 5  June 2023   escape stairs present additional hazards to people escaping from buildings in the case of 
fire. This is because the escape stair may be exposed to inclement weather during  the 
evacuation. For this reason, an external escape stair should not serve a building where the 
topmost storey height is more than 7.5 m above the adjacent ground.  
In order to protect the occupants from fire and smoke during evacuation, the ex ternal 
escape stair should be protected against the outbreak of fire from within the building.  
Where the escape stair has a total rise of more than 1.6 m, every part of the external wall 
including fixed windows or glazing, self -closing fire doors (other th an a door opening from 
the top storey) or any other opening not more than 2 m from the escape stair, should have 
a short fire resistance duration. Fire protection below an escape stair should be extended 
to the lowest ground level.  
An external escape stair  with a total rise of not more than 1.6 m from which occupants can 
freely disperse, is considered to be low enough above the ground to present minimal risk 
to occupants leaving the building and as a result, fire protection need not be provided.  
2.9.23  Escape routes - open access balconies 
An open access balcony can be used as an escape routes from flats or maisonettes. Fire 
and smoke should ventilate more freely than an enclosed escape route. The balcony 
should be open to the external air and hav e an opening that extends over at least four - 
fifths of its length and at least one third of its height.  
Where only one direction of escape is available, the travel distance along an open access 
balcony should be not more than 40 m. However where the balco ny provides 2 directions 
of escape, the travel distance can be unlimited.  
Flames and smoke from a fire may emanate from a window or other opening in the 
external wall of a flat or maisonette. Therefore, where an open access balcony provides 
escape in 1 dir ection only, the external wall up to a height of at least 1.1 m above the level 
of the balcony should be provided with a short fire resistance duration to allow evacuees to 
pass below the level of windows in relative safety. Any door in the external wall s hould be 
a self-closing fire doors with a short fire resistance  duration.  
In order to protect occupants escaping from flats or maisonettes on storeys above the fire 
floor, every open access balcony should have a medium fire resistance duration from the 
underside. Openings in the floor of the balcony should be fire- stopped in accordance with 
the guidance to Standard 2.2.  
Wide balconies above the floor of fire origin could present a risk to occupants escaping on 
the fire floor. This is because lateral fire an d smoke spread along the underside of the 
balcony may compromise the escape route. Therefore, in order to inhibit lateral fire and 
smoke spread, every balcony more than 2 m wide should be provided with smoke 
channels or down- stands at 90 degrees to the fac e of the building on the same line as the 
separating wall between each dwelling. The depth of the smoke channel or down- stand 
should be at least 300 mm below the soffit of the balcony.

Page 131 Applicable from 5  June 2023   2.9.24  Escape routes - refuge within  buildings  
Research and fire inv estigation reports from fire and rescue services show that the 
incidence of multiple fire deaths and injuries beyond the dwelling of fire origin is 
uncommon. This is because:  
* fire and smoke spread is contained mainly to the dwelling of fire origin by the 
construction of separating walls and separating floors (see Standard 2.2)  
* occupants in flats and maisonettes (other than the flat or maisonette of fire origin) are 
protected from fire and smoke by the construction of separating walls and separating 
floors, and 
* fire and rescue service intervene and control fire spread.  
However there are occasions where the common escape routes serving flats and 
maisonettes may be compromised by fire and smoke. For example, where a fire has 
accidentally or deliberately been set in the protected zone or protected lobby.  
Where a domestic building and a non- domestic building share a protected zone (see 
clause 2.9.17), the occupants in the domestic building should be provided with additional 
protection. A protected lobby is necessary between an escape stair and every:  
* non-domestic building  
* flat 
* maisonette, and  
* ancillary room or  space.  
Occupants who are confronted by fire and smoke in the common space may retreat back 
into their flat or maisonette and contact the emergency services. Control room personnel 
will provide helpful advice and attempt to keep callers calm whilst awaiting arrival of the 
fire and rescue service.  
Occupants should be able to remain safely inside the building until the fire has burnt itself 
out or until the fire has been contained and it is safe to use the escape route. In most 
cases, the fire and rescue service will intervene and commence fire- fighting and rescue 
operations before all occupants have made their escape to a place of safety.  
Although a rare event, i f the spread of fire and smoke is significant, it may be necessary to 
evacuate the floor of fire origin or the entire building as a precaution. This will normally be 
co-ordinated by the fire and rescue service with assistance from the other emergency 
servi ces such as the police and ambulance services. In order to assist the fire and rescue 
service in this task an evacuation alert system for their use should be installed to BS 8629: 
2019 (currently under development, see Standard 2.14 for additional guidance).

Page 132 Applicable from 5  June 2023   2.10 Escape  lighting  
Mandatory Standard  
Standard 2.10  
Every building must be designed and constructed in such a way that in the 
event of an outbreak of fire within the building, illumination is provided to assist 
in escape.  
 
 
2.10.0  Introduction 
In seeking to escape from a building the occupants will find it easier if the escape routes 
are illuminated. Specifically dedicated escape lighting is not necessary within dwellings as 
it is assumed the occupants will have a degree of familiar ity with the layout, and escape 
routes only begin at the door to the dwelling. However in buildings containing flats and 
maisonettes, the common escape routes should be illuminated to assist the occupants of 
the building to make their way to a place of saf ety. 
Conversions - in the case of conversions, as specified in regulation 4, the building as 
converted shall meet the requirement of this standard (regulation 12, schedule 6).  
2.10.1  Escape route  lighting 
Escape route lighting utilises the artificial lighting within the building, but should be 
supplied by a fire protected circuit.  
Every part of an escape route should have artificial lighting supplied by a protected  circuit 
that provides a level of illumination not less than that recommended for emergency lighting. 
Where artificial lighting serves a protected zone, it should be via a protected circuit 
separate from that supplying any other part of the escape route.  
Artificial lighting supplied by a protected circuit need not be provided if a system of 
emergency lighting is installed.  
2.10.2  Protected  circuits  
A protected circuit is a circuit originating at the main incoming switch or distribution board, 
the conductors of which are protected against fire. Regardless of what system is 
employed, escape routes should be capable of being illuminated when the building is in 
use. In conversions for example, it may be easier to install self -contained emergency 
luminaries than to install a protected circuit to the existing lighting system.  
2.10.3  Emerge ncy lighting 
Emergency lighting is lighting designed to come into, or remain in, operation automatically 
in the event of a local and general power failure.  
################# - Page 133 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 133 Applicable from 5  June 2023   Emergency lighting should be installed in buildings considered to be at higher risk. In a 
building c ontaining flats or maisonettes emergency lighting should be provided in the 
following areas:  
* an underground car park including any protected zone serving it, where less than 30% 
of the perimeter of the car park is open to the external air  
* a protected zone or unprotected zone serving a basement storey or a protected zone 
or unprotected zone in a high rise domestic  building.  
The emergency lighting should be installed in accordance with BS 5266: Part 1: 2016 as 
read in association with BS 5266: Part 7: 1999 (B S EN: 1838: 2013).  
In order to assist the evacuation of occupants in high rise domestic buildings, every 
protected lobby, protected zone (including escape stairs) and any other associated escape 
route should be provided with emergency lighting designed and  installed in accordance 
with BS 5266: Part 1: 2005 as read in association with (BS EN: 1838: 2013).

Mandatory Standard  
Standard 2.11  
Every building must be designed and constructed in such a way that in the 
event of an outbreak of fir e within the building, the occupants are alerted to the 
outbreak of fire.  
 
 
2.11.0  Introduction 
Over 90% of Scottish fire deaths occur in the dwelling of fire origin. Asphyxiation caused 
by smoke inhalation is the primary cause of death. If there is an outbreak of fire within a 
dwelling, early detection and warning to the occupants can play a vital r ole in increasing 
their chances of escape. This is particularly important as the occupants may well be asleep 
and are more likely to react slower.  
Most fires in dwellings are accidental and statistics show that the main sources of ignition 
are: Cooking appliances, smoking related, candles, electrical supply and other domestic 
appliances.  
Occupant characteristics -  in the 4 years 2014- 2015 to 2017- 2018 where fatalities were 
recorded, on average 30% of fires started in the living room, 17% in bedrooms, and 15% in 
the kitchen. This means that a significant number of fire related deaths, 62% or 107 deaths 
over the 4 year period, occurred from fires starting in these rooms. It is therefore important 
that the outbreak of fire in living rooms and kitchens is detect ed quickly and the alarm 
raised as early as possible during the early stages of fire growth.  
Tolerable Standards -  in January 2019 amendments to the tolerable standards 
introduced a requirement for all dwellings to be fitted with heat and smoke alarms and 
carbon monoxide detection by February 2021. Guidance in support of the tolerable 
standards calls for interlinked heat and smoke detection to be sited as per the guidance 
contained in this technical handbook, with the allowance that the installation may be 
powered by sealed for life battery units. However, where an existing partial or full mains 
operated heat and smoke detection system is being altered it would normally be expected 
to replace mains wired devices with mains wired units.  
Conversions - in the c ase of conversions, as specified in regulation 4, the building as 
converted shall meet the requirement of this standard (regulation 12, schedule 6).  
2.11.1  Fire detection and fire alarm  systems  
Living rooms and kitchens should be fitted with fire detectors  because they are the most 
likely sources of fire in dwellings and result in the greatest number of fatalities and injuries 
in Scotland each year. Statistics also show that bedrooms and other rooms or spaces 
within a dwelling also contribute to the overall  number of casualties in Scotland and as a 
result the circulation spaces outside these rooms or spaces should be protected to give 
early warning of fire.  
################# - Page 135 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 135 Applicable from 5  June 2023   Therefore, in order to provide a fire detection and fire alarm system that should alert 
occupants to t he outbreak of fire, a Grade D system should be installed in all dwellings, 
comprising of:  
 
* at least 1 smoke alarm installed in the principal habitable room  
* at least 1 smoke alarm in every circulation space on each storey such as hallways and 
landings  
* at least 1 smoke alarm in every access room serving an inner room  
* at least 1 heat alarm installed in every  kitchen.  
 
The principal habitable room is the most frequently used room by the occupants of a 
dwelling for general daytime living purposes.  
Where a dwelling has an open plan layout, the open plan area will also be used as a 
circulation space (which could include a stair and landing). The location and siting of 
smoke alarms and heat detectors should follow both the guidance above and in Clause 
2.11.7 t o determine the appropriate number of alarms.  
Inner rooms -  where occupants' only escape route is through another room (the access 
room) they are at risk if a fire starts in the access room. Therefore, every access room 
should be provided with a smoke alar m to give occupants of the inner room early warning.  
Where the access room is a kitchen, the type of detector should be carefully considered to 
reduce the likelihood of false alarms.  
Any inner room at a height of more than 4.5 m should be designed in accor dance with the 
guidance to clause 2.9.7.  
Common systems -  in a building containing flats or maisonettes, a common fire alarm 
and detection system that interlinks all dwellings and common spaces is not recommended 
due to the risk of unwanted false alarms. H owever in a sheltered housing complex, 
monitoring equipment is recommended due to the vulnerability of the occupants.  
Detailed guidance on fire detection and fire alarm systems in dwellings can be obtained 
from BS 5839: Part 6: 2019.  
2.11.2  Choice of fire  detector  
False alarms are common in dwellings and may result in the occupants disabling the fire 
detection and fire alarm system. The most common causes of a false alarm are:  
* fumes from cooking (including toasting of bread)  
* steam from bathrooms, shower rooms and kitchens  
* tobacco smoke  
* dust 
* aerosol spray and incense  
* candles  
* high humidity, and  
################# - Page 136 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 136 Applicable from 5  June 2023   * water ingress.  
Consideration should therefore be given to the type of fire detector in order to reduce the 
amount of unwanted false alarms. There are 4 main t ypes of fire detector used in 
dwellings:  
* optical smoke alarms  
* ionisation smoke alarms  
* multi sensor alarms, and  
* heat alarms . 
2.11.3  Optical smoke  alarms 
Optical smoke alarms should conform to BS EN 14604: 2005 and operate on the principle 
of detecting the s cattering or absorption of light within the detector chamber. Optical 
smoke alarms are more sensitive to slow smouldering fires such as fires involving soft 
furnishings and bedding.  
Principal habitable room -  the most likely source of fire in a principal habitable room is 
the careless disposal of smoking materials. Polyurethane foam found in some furnishings 
may ignite and begin to smoulder producing large particles of smoke. Optical smoke 
alarms are therefore recommended in principal habitable rooms however if the room is 
used by a heavy smoker, this could give rise to some false alarms from tobacco smoke.  
In cases where a principal habitable room is open plan with a kitchen, an optical smoke 
alarm is recommended to reduce the amount of unwanted alarms from  cooking fumes.  
Circulation spaces -  most unwanted alarms occur during cooking. Optical smoke alarms 
are less sensitive from fumes caused by toasting bread or frying or grilling food. Therefore, 
optical smoke alarms are recommended in hallways and stairwel ls adjacent to kitchens.  
2.11.4  Ionisation smoke  alarms  
Ionisation smoke alarms should conform to BS EN 14604: 2005 and operate on the 
principle that the electrical current flowing between electrodes in an ionisation chamber is 
reduced when smoke particles  enter the chamber. Ionisation smoke alarms are more 
sensitive to smoke containing small particles such as rapidly burning flaming fires but are  
less sensitive to steam. Therefore, ionisation smoke alarms are recommended in hallways 
and stairwells adjacent  to bathrooms or shower rooms to reduce the amount of unwanted 
false alarms.  
Circulation spaces -  multi- sensor alarms are recommended in hallways and stairwells 
adjacent to bathrooms or shower rooms to reduce the amount of unwanted false alarms.  
2.11.5  Multi sensor  alarms  
A multi -sensor alarm provides the early warning of fire and can significantly reduce the 
amount of unwanted false alarms in certain circumstances. See BS 5839: Part 6: 2019 for 
more detailed information.  
 
################# - Page 137 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 137 Applicable from 5  June 2023   2.11.6  Heat  alarms 
Heat alarms conforming to BS 5446: Part 2: 2003 have fixed- temperature elements and 
operate on the principle of responding to the temperature of the fire gases in the 
immediate vicinity of the heat alarm. Heat alarms are used where ambient temperatures 
are likely to fluc tuate rapidly over a short period such as in kitchens and are less likely to 
produce false alarms. Elsewhere, heat alarms should not be used instead of smoke alarms 
to reduce unwanted false alarms.  
2.11.7  Siting of fire  detectors  
The guidance in this clause takes account of the audibility levels in adjoining rooms and 
the effect of smoke travelling along a ceiling.  
Smoke alarms and heat alarms by their definition, include an integral sounder. Smoke 
alarms are designed to produce a sound output of 85 dB (A) at 3m. Therefore, allowing for 
sound attenuation through a domestic door by around 20 dB(A), a sound level of between 
55 - 65 dB(A) is likely at the bed- head in each bedroom which should rouse the 
occupants. There is no evidence to suggest that lives are being lost in dwellings due to 
audibility levels other than when people are incapacitated to such a degree (e.g. by alcohol 
or drugs), that even higher sound levels would not waken them.  
Smoke from a fire in a dwelling is normally hot enough that it ris es and forms a layer below 
the ceiling. As the smoke rises and travels horizontally it mixes with air which increases 
the size of the smoke particles. This means that ionisation smoke alarms may be less 
sensitive to the smoke. Where a hallway is very long,  the smoke might cool to such an 
extent that it loses buoyancy and spreads along the floor.  
Audibility - smoke alarms should be located in circulation spaces:  
* not more than 7 m from the door to a living room or  kitchen  
* not more than 3 m from every bedroom door, and  
* in circulation spaces more than 7.5 m long, no point within the circulation space should 
be more than 7.5 m from the nearest smoke alarm.  
A smoke alarm located in an access room (which could include a stair and landing), 
serving an inner room should be not more than 3 m from the door of the inner room.  
Smoke travel -  a smoke alarm in the principal habitable room should be sited such that no 
point in the room is more than 7.5 m from the nearest smoke alarm and in the case of a 
heat alarm, no point in the kitchen should be more than 5.3 m from the nearest heat 
detector.  
All dimensions should be measured horizontally.  
Smoke might not reach a smoke alarm where it is located on or close to a wall or other 
obstruction. Therefore, smoke alarms should be c eiling mounted and positioned away from 
any wall or light fitting. In order to reduce unwanted false alarms, smoke alarms should not 
be sited directly above heaters, air conditioning ventilators or other ventilators that might 
draw dust and fine particles into the smoke alarm.  
Smoke alarms and heat alarms should be ceiling mounted and located such that their 
sensitive elements are:  
################# - Page 138 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 138 Applicable from 5  June 2023   * in the case of a smoke alarm, between 25 mm and 600 mm below the ceiling, and at 
least 300 mm away from any wall or light fitti ngs, and 
* in the case of a heat alarm, between 25 mm and 150 mm below the ceiling.  
2.11.8  Grade of fire detection and fire alarm  system  
Monitoring of wiring or faults reduces the amount of time which a system is likely to be 
disabled before a fault in the system is discovered. A visual indicator or warning signal 
should be provided to alert the occupant that there is a fault with the system.  
Therefore, at least a Grade D fire detection and fire alarms system should be installed in 
every dwelling which c omprises 1 or more mains powered smoke alarm and 1 or more 
mains powered heat alarm with an integral standby supply in accordance with BS 5839: 
Part 6: 2019.  
However a sheltered housing complex normally provides accommodation for vulnerable 
occupants with a diverse range of support needs. Therefore, a fire alarm signal should be 
transmitted to a remote monitoring service or to a warden who can assist with any 
evacuation if necessary, or call for assistance.  
In order to achieve this principle, a Grade C syst em should be installed in every dwelling in 
a sheltered housing complex which comprises central control equipment in accordance 
with BS 5839: Part 6: 2019, and:  
* 1 or more mains powered smoke alarms and 1 or more mains powered heat alarms 
with an integral s tandby supply, or  
* point fire detectors and separate sounders.  
2.11.9  Wiring and power  
Research shows that significant proportion of battery operated smoke alarms fail to 
operate during the outbreak of a fire. The main reason for this is that the battery is  either 
faulty or has been removed from the alarm. Therefore, smoke alarms and heat alarms 
should be mains operated and permanently wired to a circuit which should take the form of 
either:  
* an independent circuit at the main distribution board, in which cas e no other electrical 
equipment should be connected to this circuit (other than a dedicated monitoring 
device installed to indicate failure of the mains supply to the alarms), or  
* a separately electrically protected regularly used local lighting circuit.  
The standby supply for smoke alarms and heat alarms may take the form of a primary 
battery, a secondary battery or a capacitor.  
The capacity of the standby supply should be sufficient to power the smoke alarms and 
heat alarms in the quiescent mode for at least 72 hours whilst giving an audible or visual 
warning of power supply failure, after which there should remain sufficient capacity to 
provide a warning for a further 4 minutes or, in the absence of a fire, a fault warning for at 
least 24 hours.  
Interconnection - all smoke alarms and heat alarms in a dwelling should be 
interconnected so that detection of a fire in any alarm, operates the alarm signal in all of 
################# - Page 139 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 139 Applicable from 5  June 2023   them. Smoke alarms and heat alarms should be interconnected in accordance with BS 
5839: Part 6: 2019.  
The system should be installed in accordance with the manufacturers written instructions. 
This should include a limitation on the number of smoke alarms and heat alarms which 
may be interconnected.  
2.11.10  Radio linked  systems  
Radio linked in terconnection between hard wired smoke alarms and/or heat alarms may 
be used for a Grade D system. More detailed guidance on the use of radio linked 
technology can be obtained from, BS 5839: Part 6: 2019.

Mandatory Standard  
Standard 2.12  
Every building must be accessible to fire and rescue service.  
 
 
2.12.0  Introduction 
Vehicle access to the exterior of a building is needed to enable high reach appliances, 
such as turntable ladders and hydraulic platforms, to be used, and to enable pumping 
appliances to supply water and equipment for fire- fighting and rescue activities. The 
access arrangements increase with building size and height.  
Conversions - in the case of conversions, as specified in regulation 4, the building as 
converted shall meet the requirements of this standard in so far as is reasonably 
practicable, and in no case be worse than before the conversion (regulation 12, schedule 
6). 
2.12.1  Vehicle access  provision 
Access from a public road should be provided to as sist fire and rescue personnel in their 
rescue and fire- fighting operations. Whilst the access will depend to some extent on the 
vehicles and equipment used, assistance may be provided from adjoining fire and rescue 
services when the need arises. For this reason, the more demanding guidance for high 
reach appliances may be recommended by the fire and rescue service. This may have a 
significant impact on planning and a feasibility study may be appropriate. Consultation with 
the fire and rescue service at the earliest opportunity is strongly recommended.  
Vehicle access should be provided to at least one elevation of all domestic building to 
assist in fire -fighting and rescue operations.  
Flats or maisonettes with a common entrance, a vehicle access route for fi re-fighting 
vehicles from a public road should be provided not more than 45 m from the common 
entrance.  
In addition, where dry or wet fire mains are installed in a building, parking spaces should 
be provided for fire and rescue service vehicles a distance not more than 18 m from riser 
inlets. The intention is to assist fire and rescue service personnel connect a short length of 
hose between the pumping appliance and the inlets to the fire mains quickly and efficiently 
therefore saving operational time.  
Howe ver vehicle access routes to more than one elevation may not always be possible 
due to the constraints of the site, and pedestrian access for fire and rescue service 
personnel, as described in clause 2.12.4, may be sufficient. In such cases, advice from the 
fire and rescue service should be sought.  
Every house should be provided with a vehicle access route for fire- fighting vehicles from 
a public road to not more than 45 m from any door giving direct access to the interior of the 
dwelling.  
################# - Page 141 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 141 Applicable from 5  June 2023   2.12.2  Vehicle ac cess  routes  
Access routes to buildings for fire and rescue service vehicles or personnel should not be 
assessed in isolation and the proposed vehicle access routes will in effect, will be dictated 
by need for water hydrants and other fire- fighting facilities such as fire mains (see clause 
2.14.7).  
Dead end route -  fire and rescue service vehicles should not have to reverse more than 
20 m from the end of an access road. Where any dead- end route is more than 20 m long, 
turning facilities should be provided. T his can be a turning circle or a hammerhead 
designed on the basis of the diagram and table below.  
In rural areas, access from a public road may not be possible to within 45 m of an entrance 
to the building, and access from a private road will suffice provi ded the guidance in the 
table below has been followed. The vehicle access route assumes that access for 
pumping appliances will be sufficient for houses, but that provision for high reach 
appliances should be made to buildings containing flats or maisonett es. Where, in 
consultation with the fire and rescue service access is only needed for pumping 
appliances, the smaller dimensions for a house may be used.

2.12.3  Operating spaces for high reach  appliances 
Following consultation with the fire and rescue service, if it is recommended that an 
operating space, or spaces, for a high reach appliance should be provided, the operating 
space(s) should:  

################# - Page 142 -  ##################

Page 142 Applicable from 5  June 2023   * have a ground loading capacity of not less than 8.3 kg/cm2, and 
* be level or not have a gradient more than 1 in 12.  
The operating space shown in the diagram below is suitable for either a hydrauli c platform 
or turntable ladder. Where the building has obstructions such as balconies or other 
projections, the building line should be taken to be the outer edge of the balconies or other 
projections.  
Figure 2.8 Minimum dimensions for operating space for  high reach appliances  
 
2.12.4  Access for fire and rescue service  personnel  
It is common practice for fire and rescue service personnel to enter a domestic building 
through the normal entrances and fight the fire head on. This is termed 'offensive fire-  
fighting'.  
In order to allow unobstructed access to a domestic building for fire and rescue service 
personnel, a paved (or equivalent) footpath at least 900 mm wide (see also Section 4 
Safety) should be provided to the normal entrances, of a building.  
In addition, where vehicle access is not possible to within 18 m of the dry riser inlets (see 
clause 2.12.1), a footpath should also be provided to the riser inlets. This will allow the fire 
and rescue service to deploy portable pumps to relay water supplies to where the water is 
needed. Whilst this method of water distribution is quite common, it should be avoided for 
new developments because of the time delay in supplying water to the fire- fighters.  
Every elevation which is provided with vehicle or pedestrian access for fire and rescue 
service personnel should have a door giving access to the interior of the building. Inward 
opening doors are preferable because this allows easier forced entry by fire and rescue 
service personnel should the need arise. However an outward opening final exit door or 
emergency door should also be considered as providing suitable access.

Mandatory Standard  
Standard 2.13  
Every building must be provided with a water supply for use b y the fire and 
rescue service.  
 
 
2.13.0  Introduction 
The fire and rescue service should be provided with a water supply to assist with their fire-  
fighting and rescue operations. This is normally provided from public water mains through 
fire hydrants or al ternative water supplies such as tanks or reservoirs may be provided.  
In some cases, the existing water supply may be sufficient and there is no need to provide 
additional water supplies. Therefore, it is important to consult the fire and rescue service 
and water authority early in the design process to establish what water supply, if any, 
should be provided in order to carry out their statutory duties under the Fire (Scotland) Act 
2005 as amended.  
Conversions - in the case of conversions, as specified in r egulation 4, the building as 
converted shall meet the requirement of this standard (regulation 12, schedule 6).  
 
2.13.1  Fire and rescue service water  supply  
Fires in domestic buildings are generally smaller than fires in non- domestic buildings. 
Domestic building fires are usually contained within the dwelling or other ancillary room or 
space of fire origin. There may be sufficient water stored in the pumping appliance to fight 
the fire and carry out rescue operations without the need to connect to a fire hy drant. 
However there are occasions where the fire has spread or is difficult to contain such as 
fires in concealed spaces, and additional water supplies will be necessary to replenish the 
water storage tank on the appliance.  
Every domestic building should,  where agreed with the fire and rescue service, be 
provided with a water supply to assist fire- fighting and rescue operations from:  
* a public water supply, or  
* an alternative water supply.  
2.13.2  Public water  supply  
A domestic building should be erected no more than 100 m from a fire hydrant. An existing 
hydrant may be used in agreement with the fire and rescue service. Additional hydrants 
may be required in those cases where the building has fire mains (see Standard 2.14).  
################# - Page 144 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 144 Applicable from 5  June 2023   Where a domestic building is being  erected more than 100 m from an existing fire hydrant, 
the fire and rescue service should be consulted to establish whether additional fire 
hydrants are necessary to assist fire- fighting and rescue operations.  
Where a new fire hydrant is required, it should be connected to a water service pipe 
capable of delivering water at a flow rate of 1500 litres per minute, provided by a water 
main vested in a public water authority or a water supply provided under the Fire 
(Scotland) Act 2005, as amended.  
A fire hydr ant should be clearly indicated by a plate, affixed nearby in a conspicuous 
position, in accordance with BS 3251:1976.  
2.13.3  Alternative water  supply  
Where no piped water supply is available, or there is insufficient pressure and flow in the 
water main, or an alternative arrangement is proposed, the alternative source of supply 
should be considered as appropriate by the fire and rescue service.

Page 145 Applicable from 5  June 2023   2.14 Fire and rescue service  facilities  
Mandatory Standard  
Standard 2.14  
Every building must be designed and constructed in such a way that facilities 
are provided to assist fire -fighting or rescue operations.  
 
 
2.14.0  Introduction 
Facilities within a building are provided to assist the fire and rescue service carry out their 
statutory duties as efficiently and s afely as possible. Fire and rescue service personnel are 
trained to enter buildings following the outbreak of fire to assist with any evacuation of the 
building occupants, effect rescues of any casualties and to fight fires. Fire- fighters 
operational duties are made on a statutory basis in the Fire (Scotland) Act 2005 as 
amended, which states:  
"Each relevant authority shall make provision for the purpose of - 
a. extinguishing fires in its area  
b. protecting life and property in the event of fires in its area."  
The extent of fire development will vary with each incident and in any situation, the fire and 
rescue service will assess the need to evacuate the entire building whilst the fire is brought 
under control. Sometimes, the fire can develop to such an extent that additional fire -
fighting teams may need to be summoned from other fire stations or fire authorities.  
Fire-fighters will normally enter a building through the main entrance and attempt to attack 
the fire. This is termed 'offensive fire- fighting' and is normal practice regardless of whether 
people are in the building or not. When conditions within the building become too 
hazardous for fire- fighters to remain, they will normally retreat a safe distance away from 
the building and implement 'defensive' fire- fighting tactics to control the spread of fire. In 
cases where a large fire develops, numerous fire- fighting teams may be involved using a 
combination of offensive and defensive tactics until the fire is brought under control and 
extinguished. Due to the hig h level of fire separation and containment within a building 
containing flats and maisonettes, it would be unusual for there to be a need to evacuate 
the fire floor or the entire building in the event of a fire. The level of fire separation should 
be such that, other than in the flat of fire origin, residents are safe to remain within their 
own flat or maisonette. However, circumstances may arise in which fire- fighters consider it 
necessary to evacuate residents from a small number of other flats and, on very rare 
occasions, the entire building. An evacuation alert system should be provided to assist the 
fire and rescue services in the evacuation of high rise domestic buildings if necessary (see 
clause 2.14.8).  
Whilst fire -fighters are professionally trained to deal with all types of fire condition, the fire 
and rescue service facilities within a building are important to reduce fire attack time which 
in turn, could save lives, limit the fire damage to property and improve fire- fighter safety.

Page 146 Applicable from 5  June 2023   Conversions - in the case of conversions, as specified in regulation 4, the building as 
converted shall meet the requirement of this standard (regulation 12, schedule 6).  
2.14.1  Fire and rescue service  facilities  
Fire and rescue service facilities may need to be provided in a building to assist with any 
evacuation of the building occupants, effect rescues of any casualties and to fight fires. 
The time taken for fire and rescue service intervention is dependent on a number of 
variables. The time to contact the emergency services, the location of the building in 
relation to the fire station and the height of the floor of fire origin above or below the fire 
and rescue service access level.  
Fires in tall buildings or in basement storeys may present additional risks to fire and rescue 
service personnel. Fire and smoke can suddenly change direction and intensity due to a 
number of factors which might induce reverse air flows. For example, the wind direction 
and velocity (which increases with height) could have a significant impac t when fire -fighters 
open the door to the dwelling of fire origin. Similarly, limited ventilation available in a 
basement storey can lead to heat and smoke build up that is released through the opening 
the fire -fighters are using as an entry point.  
It is important that the facilities to assist the fire and rescue services take account of the 
building design. The Building Disaster Assessment Group carried out extensive research 
on behalf of the UK Government to assess the interaction between building design and the 
operational response of fire and rescue services. The subjects covered by the research 
included:  
* physiological performance criteria for fire- fighting  
* fire-fighting in under -ventilated compartments,  and 
* fire-fighting media in high- rise buildings.  
The research is available on the UK Government website at Fire prevention and rescue -  
GOV.UK (www.gov.uk) . 
2.14.2  Number and type of  facilities  
Houses - facilities to assist the fire and rescue service need not be provided in a house. 
This is because the forward control point will be set up outside the building and the 
operations will commence from that point.  
Flats and maisonettes -  the further f ire-fighters need to travel to reach the seat of the fire 
above or below ground, the greater the risk. Therefore, the number and type of facilities 
should be provided based on the height of the topmost storey above the fire and rescue 
service access level,  the depth of any basement storeys below the access level and the 
distance from any fire mains outlets (see clause 2.14.7).  
Facilities that may be necessary include:  
* fire-fighting stairs (see clause 2.14.3)  
* fire-fighting lifts (see clause 2.14.4)  
* fire-fighting lobbies (see clause 2.14.5)  
* heat and smoke control e.g. natural or mechanical ventilation (see clause 2.14.6), and  
################# - Page 147 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 147 Applicable from 5  June 2023   * fire mains i.e. wet or dry risers (see clause 2.14.7).  
Height of topmost storey -  building design should complement fire- fighting and rescue 
capability. The 7.5 m storey height above the ground is historically linked to the height at 
which fire and rescue service personnel can rescue occupants using the standard 13.5 m 
portable ladder. Whilst this practice is no longer common, for health and safety reasons, 
fire fighters continue to carry out external rescues as a last resort and building design 
should recognise this.  
The 18 m storey height above the ground is also historically linked with the reach 
capability of fire and rescue service equipment such as wheeled escape ladders (now 
obsolete). The general intent is that buildings with a storey at a height of more than 18 m 
above the access level, cannot be easily reached by fire and rescue service equipment 
and personnel.  
Therefore, at least 1 fire -fighting shaft (fire -fighting stair, fire -fighting lobby, fire mains and 
in some cases a fire- fighting lift) is provided within the building to allow equipment and 
personnel to be deployed as quickly as possible.  
In addition, fire -fighters cannot apply water jets from fire hoses onto external walls high 
above the ground because of the limited reach capability. The guidance throughout this 
handbook including Standard 2.7, fire spread on external walls, recognises this limitation.  
The fire and rescue s ervice facilities recommended in the table should be applied on every 
storey however the lowest basement storey sets the level of facilities recommended 
throughout the basement storeys only. The depth of the lowest basement storey is 
measured from the fire  and rescue service access level to the upper surface of the lowest 
basement storey. The height of the topmost storey of a building is measured from the fire 
and rescue service access level to the upper surface of the topmost storey.

Additional information:  
1. The access level is the level at which the fire and rescue service enter the building to 
commence fire- fighting and rescue operations.  
2. Ventilation to stairs includes both escape stairs and fire- fighting stairs (see clause 
2.14.6).  
2.14.3  Fire-fighting  stairs  
At least 1 fire- fighting stair should be provided to assist fire- fighters to access the fire and if 
necessary escape from the fire in relative safety. The fire- fighting stair should be at least 
1.0 m wide measured between handrails to provide fire and rescue service personnel 
sufficient room to carry fire- fighting and rescue equipment.  
A fire -fighting stair and where required a fire- fighting lobby and fire- fighting lift should be 
contained within a protected zone. The enclosing structur e of the protected zone should 
have at least a medium fire resistance duration. The protected zone should have a long 
fire resistance duration where it serves a building where the topmost storey is more than 
18 m above the fire and rescue service access level. A self -closing fire door in the 
enclosing structure of a protected zone should have a short fire resistance duration and in 
the case of a high rise domestic buildings, a medium fire resistance duration. A fire- fighting 
stair can also be used as an esc ape stair.  
The wall separating the fire- fighting stair from the fire- fighting lobby (where necessary, see 
table to clause 2.14.2) should have at least a medium fire resistance duration and the self - 
################# - Page 149 -  ##################

Page 149 Applicable from 5  June 2023   closing fire door should have at least a short fire resis tance duration. The wall separating 
the fire -fighting lobby from the remainder of the building should have a long fire resistance 
duration and the door should be a self -closing fire door with a medium fire resistance 
duration.  
Figure 2.9 Building with a s torey height more than 18m  
 
Note: For heat and smoke control see clause 2.14.6  
2.14.4  Fire-fighting  lifts 
In high rise domestic buildings, a fire- fighting lift should be provided to assist fire- fighters to 
transport equipment to a floor of their choice as quickly as possible. The lift also allows 
fire-fighters to access several floors quickly to assess the situation and to rescue any 
casualties.  
The fire- fighting lift installation includes the lift car itself, the lift well and the lift machinery 
space, together with the lift control system and the lift communication system. The lift 
control and communication system should be capable of being used under the direct 

################# - Page 150 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 150 Applicable from 5  June 2023   control of the fire and rescue services. The lift installation should conform to BS EN 81: 
Part 72: 2015 and BS EN 81: Part 20: 2014 or BS EN 81: Part 50: 2014 depending on the 
type of lift.  
A fire -fighting lift should be located within a protected zone and constructed within its own 
compartment having at least a medium fire resistance duration. The lift landing doors need 
only achieve a short fire resistance duration.  
The fire- fighting lift should only be entered from:  
* a fire -fighting lobby with not more than 1 door to the room or storey it serves,  or 
* an open access balcony.  
A fire -fighting lift need not serve the top storey of a building where:  
* the top storey is for service plant use only,  and 
* access to the plant room is from the fire- fighting stair from the storey below,  and 
* the foot of the fire- fighting stair is not more than 4.5 m fr om the fire -fighting lift.  
2.14.5  Fire-fighting  lobbies  
A fire -fighting lobby serves a fire- fighting stair and a fire- fighting lift where appropriate. 
Where a fire- fighting lobby is required (see table to clause 2.14.2), it should be located 
within a protected zone and should be provided on every storey. The purpose of a fire-  
fighting lobby is:  
* to allow fire -fighters to set up a forward control point at least 1 floor below the fire floor 
where fire- fighters and fire- fighting equipment can safely be assembl ed before 
commitment to fire- fighting and rescue operations  
* to protect fire- fighters when making their final approach to the fire floor  
* to protect any evacuees or fire- fighters who might be using the stair from a fire in the 
lift well or lift machine room  
* to provide fire- fighters with a safe route of egress from the fire, or if the lift should fail or 
its reliability becomes uncertain  
* to protect fire- fighters who might accidentally arrive at the fire floor  
* to reduce the potential for fire- fighters to become disoriented due to poor visibility, and  
* to protect the lift from the effects of fire and smoke in adjoining accommodation.  
Therefore, a fire fighting lobby should be provided on every storey, and have an area of at 
least 5 m2 with all principal dimensions  at least 1.5 m. This allows fire- fighters sufficient 
room to lay out hose and connect to the outlet from a fire main.  
In buildings where the topmost storey height is more than 18 m above fire and rescue 
service access level a fire -fighting lobby should have not more than 1 door to the room or 
storey it serves.  
However a fire- fighting lobby need not be provided where:  
* the topmost storey of the building is no more than 18 m above fire and rescue service 
access level, or  
################# - Page 151 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 151 Applicable from 5  June 2023   * access to the flats and maisonettes is  from an open access balcony serving a storey in 
a building with a storey height of not more than 60 m.  
In these cases, the fire main may be located in the protected corridor, protected lobby or 
open access balcony provided an area of at least 5 m2 with all principal dimensions of at 
least 1.5 m is available at the fire main outlet which is located adjacent to the protected 
door leading to the fire -fighting stair.  
Figure 2.10 One Escape Route -  Storey height 7.5m to 18m  
 
Note: For heat and smoke control se e clause 2.14.6  
2.14.6  Heat and smoke  control  
The fire and rescue service should be provided with the facility to release smoke and heat 
from a fire during their fire- fighting and rescue operations. Ventilation should be provided 
to every escape stair, fire -fighting stair, fire- fighting lobby and to every protected lobby or 
protected corridor where appropriate (see table to clause 2.14.2). The efficiency of the 
ventilators depends upon the prevailing wind and it is important that fire- fighters can 
control the opening and closing of the ventilators on arrival at the building.  
Ventilators should be fitted with a simple handle or lock that can be easily operated by fire-  
fighters including where automatic opening ventilators are recommended in clause 2.9.15. 
If ventilators are not easily accessible they should be operated by a mechanism positioned 
within the building at the fire and rescue service access point. In the case of an escape 
stair and fire- fighting stair, a local control should also be provi ded at the topmost storey. 
This will allow fire -fighters flexibility in their operations.  

################# - Page 152 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 152 Applicable from 5  June 2023   Escape stairs and fire- fighting stairs -  ventilation should be provided to every escape 
stair and every fire- fighting stair by:  
* a ventilator of at least 1 m2 at the t op of the stair,  or 
* a ventilator of at least 0.5 m2 at each storey on an external wall,  or 
* 'Smoke shafts protecting fire- fighting shafts; their performance and design' (BRE, 
2002).  
Protected lobbies, protected corridors and fire -fighting lobbies -  ventilat ion should 
also be provided in protected lobbies, protected corridors and fire- fighting lobbies by:  
* a ventilator of at least 1.5 m2 at each storey on an external wall, or  
* smoke shafts as described in the guidance to Standard 2.9, or  
* 'Smoke shafts protecting fire -fighting shafts: their performance and design' (BRE, 
2002).  
A natural or mechanical smoke ventilation system used to satisfy Standard 2.9 may also 
be used to satisfy Standard 2.14 with the agreement of the fire and rescue service.  
2.14.7  Fire mains 
Where there is an outbreak of fire high above the fire and rescue service access level, the 
time taken to set up a forward control point, assess the situation and carry hoses up 
several flights of stairs can be considerable. Therefore, in a building where the topmost 
storey is more than 7.5m, a fire main should be installed in the fire- fighting lobby to help 
reduce fire attack time. Fire mains may be located in a protected lobby, protected corridor 
or open access balcony (see clause 2.14.5).  
A dry fire main  is a pipe installed in a building for fire- fighting purposes, which is normally 
dry but is capable of being charged with water by pumping from a fire and rescue service 
appliance. A dry fire main is commonly referred to as a 'dry riser'.  
Dry fire mains sh ould be designed and constructed in accordance with BS 9990: 2015 and 
boxes for fire mains outlets valves should conform to BS 5041: Part 4: 1975 (1987).  
The inlets to the risers should be located externally to the building and not more than 18 m 
from a parking space suitable for a pumping appliance. There should be a clear hose route 
between the appliance and the inlet.  
Wet fire main -  the pressure and flow rates delivered from fire mains reduce with height 
above the ground and may not provide an effective water jet from fire- fighting hoses.  
Therefore, where the height of the topmost storey is more than 50 m above the fire and 
rescue service access level, wet rising mains should be installed. A wet fire main is a pipe 
which is constantly charged with water supplied from a suction tank and pump. The suction 
tank should have an inlet for the emergency replenishment of water and is clearly visible to 
the fire and rescue services. A wet fire main is commonly referred to as a 'wet riser'.  
Fire mains outlets shoul d be provided on every storey of a building and the basement 
storey to permit fire -fighting operations to be conducted at any floor level when it is safe for 
fire and rescue service personnel to do so.  
If an automatic fire suppression system is installed i n the building, no point on the storey 
should be more than 60 m from the fire main outlet, measured along an unobstructed route 
################# - Page 153 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 153 Applicable from 5  June 2023   for laying a fire hose. If the building is not fitted with an automatic fire suppression system, 
no point on the storey should be more than 45 m from the outlet.  
Figure 2.11 Two Escape Routes  
 
Note: For heat and smoke control see clause 2.14.6  
2.14.8  Evacuation alert system for use by the fire and rescue  service  
In domestic buildings with a storey more than 18 m above ground level , an evacuation 
alert system (EAS) should be provided to enable the fire and rescue service to initiate 
operation of evacuation alert sounders within each dwelling on any single floor, multiple 
floors and the entire building, according to circumstances.  
An evacuation alert system is not, and should not be confused with, a fire alarm system. 
The EAS should not be integrated with a fire detection and fire alarm system (or any  other 
system), nor should any devices (such as fire detectors), other than evacuation alert 
devices, be connected to the EAS.  
An EAS system should not be used as mitigation for any defects in construction or as a 
compensatory measure for reduction in any other measures identified in this Technical 
Handbook as a means of compliance with the standards nor is it acceptable for an EAS to 
be regarded as a component of a fire engineering solution; in either case, this would imply 
fire and rescue service attendance was part of mitigating, or compensatory measures, or a 
component of a design solution, all of which would be unacceptable.  

################# - Page 154 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 154 Applicable from 5  June 2023   Control equipment for the EAS should be prominently sited, within a secure enclosure, on 
the normal fire and rescue service entrance level, at a location close to the normal fire and 
rescue service entrance. An e mergency lighting luminaire should be installed within 2m 
horizontally of the enclosure.  
A square or rectangular sign, bearing the words Evacuation Alert Control & Indicating 
Equipment "EACIE: For Fire and Rescue Services Use Only", should be fixed to the door 
of the cabinet. The wording should comprise white Sans Serif text, on a red background, 
with a lower case letter height of at least 10  mm. The sign should incorporate the red 
flames pictogram specified for fire- fighting equipment in BS 5499- 10. The si gn should be of 
metal or traffolyte construction and should be fixed to the door of the cabinet by rivets or by 
at least four security screws.  
The EAS should be designed, installed and commissioned in accordance with the 
recommendations of BS 8629: 2019.  
Within each flat, at least one evacuation alert sounder, conforming to the requirements of 
BS EN 3, should be provided. Normally, only one sounder is likely to be necessary, but the 
sound pressure level of the alarm signal at each open bedroom doorway shoul d be at least 
85 dB(A). Sound pressure level within other habitable rooms should be at least 60 dB(A) 
when all doors in the dwelling are closed. Facilities conforming to the recommendations of 
BS 8629: 2019 should be incorporated to enable additional devic es to be added to alert 
people who are Deaf or hard of hearing.  
All wiring, other than the wiring of power supplies, should comprise cables of enhanced  
fire resistance duration, as specified in BS 8629: 2019. Power supply cables may comprise 
cables of standard, or enhanced, fire resistance duration.  
BS 8629: 2019 does not provide recommendations for networked systems, in which 
evacuation alert sounders are connected to a number of local control panels ("sub-  
panels"), all connected on a data network. This arrangement might be necessary in a tall 
or very large block of flats. Such an arrangement is acceptable subject to maintaining the 
high integrity required of an evacuation alert system, following the principles in BS 8629: 
2019. In particular, the system should conform to the following recommendations:  
a. The wiring of the data network should comprise cables of enhanced fire resistance 
duration;  
b. The data network should be fault tolerant, such that, in the event of a single open or 
short circuit fault on the network cable, the system should continue to operate fully in 
accordance with the recommendations of BS 8629: 2019, while giving an audible and 
visual fault indication at central EAS control equipment;  
c. Ideally, wiring of the data network should be diverse r outed, such that the "return" leg 
of a loop circuit follows a different path from the "outward" leg. If this is not possible 
(e.g. because it is necessary for the data loop to be contained within a single service 
riser), the sub -panels and the entire data network should be located in areas of low fire 
risk (i.e. areas that are unlikely to be affected by a fire(s) in any flat, and the out and 
return legs should be separated by at least 300 mm.  
The above recommendations and those of BS 8629: 2019 are based on  the assumption 
that evacuation alert devices will be installed in all flats in a block of flats with a storey 
more than 18 m above ground level. If this is not the case, additional equipment will be 
necessary in close proximity to the EAS control equipment to indicate to the fire and

Page 155 Applicable from 5  June 2023   rescue service those flats in which evacuation alert devices have been triggered and those 
devoid of such devices.  
2.14.9  Storey identification signs and dwelling indicator  signs  
To assist the fire and rescue service to identify each storey in a domestic building with a 
storey at a height of more than 18 m above the ground storey identification signs and 
dwelling indicator signs should be provided.  
The storey identification signs, identifying the storey by "Floor Number" should be located 
on every landing of a fire- fighting stairway and every fire- fighting lobby (or open access 
balcony) into which a fire- fighting lift discharges.  
The wording used on each sign should take the form Floor X, with X designating the 
number of t he storey, as intended for reference by residents. This is important as it is likely 
to be the reference given to the fire and rescue service in any emergency call by a 
resident. Where the storey designations have not been determined, the default 
designati ons set out below should be adopted:  
* The ground floor level (which is normally the fire and rescue service entrance level) 
should be designated as either Floor 0 or Ground Floor  
* Each storey above ground level should be numbered sequentially beginning with  
Floor 1  
* A lower ground floor should be designated as Floor - 1 or Lower Ground Floor  
* A basement level(s) should be designated as Floor - 1 or Basement 1, etc., as 
appropriate.  
The font of the letters on each storey identification sign should be a sans serif  typeface 
(e.g. Helvetica Bold or Helvetica Medium). The letter height of all text should be at least 50 
mm. The height of the numeral that designates floor number should be at least 75 mm. All 
text should comprise white letters on a green background. The sign should conform to the 
requirements of BS ISO 17938 for classification C phosphorescent signs.  
Storey identification signs should be mounted such that they are clearly visible from the 
top step of a fire- fighting stairway, and from inside a fire- fighti ng lift when the lift car doors 
open. The mounting height of the signs, measured to the base of the sign, should be 
between 1.7 m and 2 m above floor level. As far as practicable, all the signs should be 
mounted at the same height.  
To enable the fire and r escue service to deploy resources with the minimum of delay, all 
storey identification signs should be supplemented by dwelling indictor signs, which 
provide information as to the dwellings (flats or maisonettes) located on the storey in 
question. The wording on each dwelling indicator sign should take the form Flats X -Y, 
where X is the lowest dwelling number, and Y is the highest dwelling number, accessed 
via the storey. In the case of maisonettes, the dwelling number should only be indicated on 
the normal  access storey for the maisonette.  
The font of the letters on each dwelling indicator sign should be a sans serif typeface (e.g. 
Helvetica Bold or Helvetica Medium). The letter height of all text, and the height of the 
dwelling numbers, should be between o ne half and two thirds of the height of the words 
and numerals of the associated storey identification signs respectively.  
################# - Page 156 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 156 Applicable from 5  June 2023   All letters and numerals of dwelling indicator signs should be set out on a contrasting 
background within the sign. The sign should conform to the requirements of BS ISO 
17398: 2004 for classification C phosphorescent signs.  
Dwelling indicator signs should be sited immediately below the storey identification signs, 
such that the top edge of the dwelling indication sign is no mor e than 50 mm below the 
bottom edge of the storey identification sign.  
On entering a corridor or open balcony serving flats from a fire- fighting stairway or a fire-
fighting lift, if dwellings are located in more than one direction, a directional dwelling 
indicator sign should be visible from the door to the corridor or open balcony. The 
directional dwelling indicator sign should comply with the recommendations for other 
dwelling indicator signs, but should incorporate arrows in conjunction with the dwelling 
numbers, indicating the direction of travel to reach each group of dwellings.

Page 157 Applicable from 5  June 2023   2.15 Automatic fire suppression  systems  
Mandatory Standard  
Standard 2.15  
Every building must be designed and constructed in such a way that, in the 
event of an outbreak of fir e within the building, fire growth will be inhibited by 
the operation of an automatic fire suppression system.  
Limitation:  
This standard applies only to a building which:  
a) is an enclosed shopping centre  
b) is a residential care building  
c) [SSI deletes text but d oes not amend letters assigned to following 
categories]  
d) forms the whole or part of a sheltered housing complex  
e) is a school building other than a building forming part of an existing 
school or an extension to a school building where it is not reasonably 
practicable to install an automatic fire suppression system in that 
building or extension  
f) is a building containing a flat or maisonette  
g) is a social housing dwelling, or  
h) is a shared multi -occupancy residential building.  
 
 
2.15.0  Introduction 
Automatic fire suppression systems installed in domestic premises are primarily designed 
for life safety purposes. Successful activation can provide occupants, including vulnerable 
occupants, with additional time to escape following the outbreak of fire. The added benefi t 
of automatic fire suppression in domestic buildings means that the damage and disruption 
caused by fire is greatly reduced.  
Automatic suppression systems react to heat therefore, the greatest protection is afforded 
to those occupants outwith the room of fire origin. Automatic suppression may provide 
some benefit to occupants in the room of fire origin where for example the fire growth is 
fast and the temperatures allow the sprinkler system (normally 1 or 2 heads) to open early 
in the development phase of the fire. The spray pattern delivered from the sprinkler heads 
should control fire spread. Whilst the effect of sprinkler spray will increase the smoke 
volume and could obscure exits, smoke temperatures and toxicity will be greatly reduced. 
In some cases, the fire might be extinguished if the fire is not shielded from the sprinkler 
spray.  
################# - Page 158 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 158 Applicable from 5  June 2023   While supporting the installation of automatic fire suppression systems in buildings, the 
Association of British Insurers (ABI) advises that claims involving the escape of  water are 
increasing year on year, costing the insurance industry in Britain PS892 million in 2019.  
Although only a relatively small proportion of this was due to leakage from automatic fire 
suppression systems, it does nonetheless reinforce the need to ensure that all water 
supply pipework in buildings, including those serving automatic fire suppression systems, 
is designed, installed and maintained correctly. The ABI have produced guidance 'ABI 
Study: Post Grenfell Research on Residential Sprinkler System s' on issues to be 
considered to improve performance and in the procurement of residential and domestic 
sprinklers which is available on the ABI website. Although primarily addressing the use of 
automatic sprinklers, much of the guidance is also applicable to other types of automatic 
fire suppression systems.  
Automatic life safety fire suppression systems are required in 3 categories of domestic 
building:  
* dwellings which form part of a sheltered housing complex,  
* buildings containing flats and maisonettes, a nd 
* social housing dwellings.  
Conversions - in the case of conversions, as specified in regulation 4, the building as 
converted shall meet the requirement of this standard (regulation 12, schedule  6). 
2.15.1  Automatic fire suppression  systems  
The term automatic life safety fire suppression system includes sprinkler systems but 
provides the opportunity for designers to propose other systems which may be just as 
effective. The key characteristics of the system are:  
* it must be automatic and not require peo ple to initiate its activation  
* it must be designed primarily to protect lives, rather than property, which means it 
should be fitted with faster responding sprinkler heads, and  
* it must be a fire suppression system, one designed specifically to deal with fi res rather 
than other hazards.  
Concealed or recessed pattern sprinkler heads may be used in the system design. 
However there is a risk that the heads are rendered ineffective or operate less efficiently 
by the application of any decorative ceiling finish. Therefore, consideration should be given 
to labelling of the heads with words to the effect of 'DO NOT PAINT'.  
Alternative suppression systems - The applicant and the verifier should satisfy 
themselves that the alternative system has been designed, tested and approved for use in 
domestic and residential buildings and are fit for their intended purpose (see Section 0). 
Watermist systems, for example, are bespoke to individual manufacturers and may be 
sensitive to small design changes. Therefore, a watermist system should be designed and 
installed in accordance with BS 8458: 2015 -  TC (tracked changes) and the nozzles should 
comply with BS 8663- 1: 2019 (provided the building is within the scope of the standards). 
Fire performance tests are critical as BS 8458 relies on this data to determine the system 
design. Watermist specialists should provide Declarations of Conformity:  
* at design stage (initial notice)  
################# - Page 159 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 159 Applicable from 5  June 2023    
* at final stage (all details and changes declared), and  
* for nozzle manufacturers, successful BS 8458 and B S 8663 fire tests.  
Portable personal protection systems are not considered suitable means of satisfying the 
requirements of Standard 2.15. They may, however, be beneficial in some unique 
situations in existing dwellings to assist in the protection of vulnerable occupants.  
Alternative approaches in a particular case may or may not be compensated by an 
automatic fire suppression system.  
2.15.2  Sheltered housing complexes  
A sheltered housing complex is a purpose built complex comprising of 2 or more dwellings 
e.g. houses, flats and maisonettes, where the occupants are likely to receive a support 
service due to the nature of their vulnerability or need e.g. age, infirmity, disability, illness, 
mental disorder or are dependent on alcohol or drugs. Such occupants are likely to react 
slowly to the fire alarm (see Standard 2.11) and the suppression system may provide the 
additional time necessary to make a safe escape.  
Therefore, a sheltered housing complex should have an automatic life safety fire 
suppression system  designed and installed in accordance with BS 9251: 2014.  
2.15.3  Buildings Containing Flats and Maisonettes 
Research and fire statistics shows that occupants in flats and maisonettes would benefit 
from automatic fire suppression systems. Whilst fire statis tics also show that fire spread 
beyond the dwelling of origin is a rare occurrence, fire dynamics suggest that any outbreak 
of fire through an external window or door opening is more likely to spread vertically than 
horizontally. Therefore, in order to protect occupants and to contain a fire in buildings 
containing flats and maisonettes, every flat and maisonette and any ancillary room should 
be provided with an automatic fire suppression system.  
A fire sprinkler system in a flat or maisonette should be designed and installed in 
accordance with BS 9251: 2014.  
2.15.4  Social Housing Dwellings  
Statistics indicate that there is a greater prevalence of fires in social housing dwellings, In 
order to help contain a fire and to protect occupants, every house, fla t and maisonette that 
is a social housing dwelling should be fitted with an automatic fire suppression system.  
A fire sprinkler system in a social housing dwelling should be designed and installed in 
accordance with BS 9251: 2014.  
2.15.5  Water  supply  
For a  suppression system to be effective it is essential that there is an appropriate water 
supply. To assist the developer or designer in the initial stages of design, Scottish Water 
have produced a policy note on the installation of automatic fire suppression systems  
titled 'Sprinkler systems for domestic and residential occupancies'. The policy note may be 
downloaded from the resource section of Scottish Water's website. However, there is still a 
################# - Page 160 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 160 Applicable from 5  June 2023   need for developers and designers to discuss project specific details with Scottish Water to 
determine what supply is likely to be available and what pressure can be expected. It is 
recognised that pressures will vary during the day and night over the year and perhaps in 
future years. Therefore, it is imperative that  the system is designed on the basis of what 
the minimum pressure and flow is likely to be. If there is any doubt, a tank and pump 
arrangement should be used.  
Therefore, it is strongly recommended that housing developers should consult Scottish 
Water and t he suppression system contractor early in the design process. For example, 
benefit could be gained through economies of scale with the agreed provision of a 
communal water supply tank and pump(s).

Page 161 Applicable from 5  June 2023   Annex 2.A  Resistance to fire 
2.A.0  Introduction 
This annex provides guidance on how to establish the resistance to fire of a building 
element or component. Whilst it could be argued that occupants of a building only need 
minutes to reach relative safety such as a protected zone, it should be remembered that 
the fire tests used to establish fire resistance duration in terms of time, do not replicate a 
real fire. In order to ensure the safe evacuation of the building occupants and to ensure 
that fire -fighters are not placed at undue risk, it is necessary to apply c ertain factors of 
safety to the fire resistance duration for structural and non- structural fire protection.  
2.A.1  Fire resistance duration 
Fire resistance durations are established from the guidance to Standards 2.1 to 2.15. 
Reference throughout this docum ent to a short, medium or long fire resistance duration, 
will be satisfied by following the guidance in the table to this annex titled 'Fire resistance 
duration for common building elements or components'. The designer is free to choose 
materials or produc ts which satisfy either the British Standard Tests or the Harmonised 
European Tests.  
Any test evidence or assessment used to substantiate the fire resistance duration of a 
wall, floor, ceiling, door or shutter should be carefully checked to ensure that is 
demonstrates compliance with appropriate fire tests and performance criteria contained in 
this handbook and is applicable to the complete installed assembly. For example, in the 
case of floors or ceilings small differences in details such as openings for l ighting or 
ventilation can significantly affect the rating. Similarly, fire doors may also have small 
differences in detail such as glazing apertures, intumescent strips, door frames and 
ironmongery etc which may significantly affect the rating.  
Transition al period -  British and European fire tests will co- exist in use until the British 
Standard classifications are withdrawn.  
2.A.2  British Standards and associated  specifications 
The recommended fire resistance duration can be attained where the construction  follows 
the guidance in the columns 3, 4 and 5 of the table below. The tests and specifications

Page 166 Applicable from 5  June 2023   Annex 2.B  Reaction to fire  
2.B.0  Introduction 
The performance criteria in terms of reaction to fire can be satisfied by the European 
Harmonised fire tests. BS EN 13501- 1: 2018 provides the fire classification procedure for 
all construction products in terms of their reaction to fire.  
2.B.1  Reaction to fire  classification  
For all construction products, the consideration is of a fire, init iated in a room, which can 
grow and eventually reach flashover. This scenario includes three fire situations 
corresponding to three stages in the development of a fire:  
* the first stage includes initiation of the fire by ignition of a product, with a small flame, 
on a limited area of a product,  
* the second stage addresses fire growth eventually reaching flashover. It is simulated 
by a single burning item in a corner of the room, creating a heat flux on adjacent 
surfaces. For floorings, fire is seen to grow in the room of origin, creating a heat flux on 
the floorings in an adjacent room or corridor, through a door opening, and  
* in the post -flashover phase all combustible products contribute to the fire load.  
External wall cladding systems -  Currently, there is no recognised European 
Harmonised fire test for facades or construction products exposed to a fire in a cavity. 
Therefore, the reaction to fire classification system in BS EN 13501- 1: 2018 for external 
wall cladding systems has been adopted. It is important  to understand the limitations of 
these tests and their intended field of application. For example, some tests are material or 
single component tests only and the single burning item (SBI) test is designed for internal 
linings. The SBI test can include the mounting technique used in its end- use application 
including any air gaps or substrate (see clause 2.B.2).  
Even if an external wall cladding system is constructed of materials achieving European 
Classification A1 and A2, clients may wish to further assess  the cladding system against 
the performance criteria in 'Fire performance of external thermal insulation for walls of 
multi- storey buildings' (BR 135, 2013) when tested in accordance with BS 8414- 1: 2020 or 
BS 8414 -2:2020. BS 9414: 2019 provides additional information on the application of 
results from BS 8414 tests. This large scale facade test may be used as an alternative to 
European Classification A1 or A2 where the external wall cladding system of a domestic 
building is less than 1 m to the boundary a nd the building has no storey at a height of 11 m 
or more above the ground.  
The local authority verifier must notify the Building Standards Division where any proposal 
is supported by BS 8414 fire tests and BR 135 classification reports. Rigorous complianc e 
checking of the design and construction must be undertaken and evidence recorded.  
A list of exemptions to European Classification A1 and A2 components that form part of a 
non-loadbearing external wall cladding system is provided below:  
* cavity trays;  
* cavity vents;

2.B.2  Harmonised European Standards  
Non-combustibility test (EN ISO 1182) identifies products that will not, or not 
significantly, contribute to a fire, regardless of their end use. The assumption is that 
products classified as A1 make no contribution to fire growth or to the fully developed fire. 
A product classified as A1 is assumed to present no smoke hazard.  
The European Commission has drawn up a list of products which, under specified 
conditions, can be considered to be class A1 without testing. This information is given in 
the Commission Decision 96/603/EC (OJ L 267 19.10.1966 p23) as amended by 
2000/605/EC (OJ L 258 12.10.2000 p36) and 2003/424/EC (OJ L 14 4 12.6.2003 p9).  
Heat of combustion test (EN ISO 1716) determines the potential maximum total heat 
release of a product when completely burning, regardless of its end use.  
Single burning item test (EN 13823) evaluates the potential contribution of a produc t to 
the development of a fire, under a fire situation simulating a single burning item in a room 
corner near to that product. When a classification includes "s3, d2" this means that there is 
no limit set for smoke production and/or flaming droplets/partic les. 
Ignitability test (EN ISO 11925 -2) evaluates the ignitability of a product under exposure to 
a small flame.  
Reaction to fire relates to the degree to which a product will contribute, by its own 
decomposition, to a fire under specified conditions. Products are classified as A1, A2, B, 
C, D, E or F (with class A1 being the highest performance and F being the lowest) in 
accordance with BS EN 13501- 1: 2018. Class F is assigned when a product fails to attain 
class E. Untested products cannot be classified i n accordance with BS EN 13501- 1: 2018.  
The classes of reaction to fire performance of A2, B, C and D are accompanied by 
additional classifications related to the production of smoke (s1, s2, s3), with s1 indicating 
################# - Page 168 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 168 Applicable from 5  June 2023   ation  the lowest production, and/or flaming droplets/particles (d0, d1, d2), with d0 indicating the 
lowest production.  
When a classification (other than as specified in Regulation 8) in this technical handbook 
refers to Class A2, B, C and D the sub- indices are deemed to include s3, d2 which means 
there is no limit set for smoke production and/or flaming droplets/particles.

2.B.3  Classified without  Testing  
There is a procedure by which certain products can be assigned a particular fire 
classification without the need for testing. Such products have well established reaction to 
fire performance and have been agreed by the Standing Committee on Construction.  
Agreements relating to such products which may be 'classified without testing' (CWT) are 
published in the Official Journal of the European Commission and are listed on the Nando-  
CPD database on the EC website.  
European Classification A1 in Table 2.10 includes a list of products drawn up by the 
European Commission which, under specified conditions, can be considered to be Class 
A1 with out testing. This information is given in the Commission Decision 96/603/EC (OJ L

Page 169 Applicable from 5  June 2023   Annex 2.C  Vulnerability of roof coverings  
2.C.0  Introduction  
This annex provides guidance on the vulnerability of roof coverings and is concerned with 
the performance of roofs when exposed to fire from neighbouring buildings.  
Commission Decision 2005/823/EC amending Decision 2001/671/EC establishing a 
classificati on system for the external fire performance of roofs and roof coverings allows 
the classification of performance by either:  
a. BS 476: Part 3: 2004 (National Test), External fire exposure roof tests,  or 
b. BS EN 13501 -5: 2016 (European Test), Fire classification of construction products and 
building elements, Part 5 -  Classification using test data from external fire exposure to 
roof tests.  
2.C.1  Vulnerability of roof  coverings 
The level of vulnerability is established from the guidance to Standard 2.1 to 2.15. 
Reference throughout this document to a low, medium or high vulnerability, will be 
satisfied by following the guidance in the table below. The British Standard classification 
does not automatically equ ate with the equivalent classifications in the European 
standards column, therefore products cannot typically assume a European class, unless 
they have been tested accordingly. The designer is free to choose materials or products, 
which satisfy either the British Standard Tests or the Harmonised European Tests.  
Transitional period -  British and European fire tests will co- exist in use until the British 
Standard classifications are withdrawn.  
2.C.2  British Standards and associated  specifications 
The national  test for roof coverings is BS 476: Part 3: 2004 which measures the capability 
of a roof to resist penetration from fire and flame spread when the external surface is 
exposed to radiation and flames.  
BS 476: Part 3: 2004 sets out a classification system based on external penetration and 
flame spread as set out in the following table. The first letter of the designation indicates 
fire penetration performance i.e. the time at which any glowing or flaming [other than that 
from the gas pilot flame] appears on t he underside of the specimen. The second letter of 
the designation indicates flame spread performance. The addition of the suffix 'X' indicates 
dripping from the underside of the specimen, any mechanical failure or development of 
holes in the specimen. The angle of the specimen in the test is designated by the prefix 'S' 
[slope] or 'F' [flat].

test 
2.C.3  Harmonised European Standards  
The European test method has been published as DD ENV 1187: 2002, 'Test methods for  
external fire exposure to roofs', which specifies four methods for determining the 
performance of roofs to external fire exposure:  
* Test 1 : with burning brands  
* Test 2 : with burning brands and wind  
* Test 3 : with burning brands, wind and supplementary radi ant heat  
* Test 4 : two stage test method incorporating burning brands, wind and supplementary 
radiant heat.  
Only test method 4 evaluates penetrability in a satisfactory way to satisfy the fire 
performance requirements in the United Kingdom. For this reason,  (t4) has been added to 
the European test designations to add clarity.  
The performance criteria in terms of vulnerability to external fire exposure can be satisfied 
where the roof covering follows the guidance in the following table. The classification 
methodology is contained in BS EN 13501- 5: 2016.

Page 174 Applicable from 5  June 2023   Section 3 -  Environment  
3.0 Introduction  
3.0.1  Background 
Water, air and soil are intricately linked and all can be affected by various forms of 
pollution that affect our environment. Other issues such as condensation have been a 
constant threat to people and buildings for many years.  
Industrial change and demographic shift during the 19th and 20th centuries  resulted in 
large- scale re -organisation of our villages, towns and cities. Industries moved out or 
disappeared altogether leaving large, 'brownfield', gaps in our landscape. At the same 
time, changes in heating methods and the advent of the consumer society, have had a 
significant effect on the type and volume of refuse it has been necessary to dispose of to 
landfill. Inevitably, these changes have left behind a legacy of land contamination that in 
some cases, may be harmful. The Scottish Government encour ages the use of previously 
developed land (brownfield) and local authorities may wish to promote brownfield land in 
preference to greenfield land. Some of this land will be contaminated and will need to be 
made safe.  
Climate is controlled by the long- term balance of energy of the Earth and its atmosphere. 
Natural events cause changes in climate but human activities can also change the climate. 
The accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere due to human activities will 
change the climate by enhancing  the natural greenhouse effect, leading to an increase in 
the Earth's average surface temperature resulting in heavier rainfall.  
Indoor air quality complaints are frequently associated with comfort issues: high or low 
temperatures, draughts, high or low humidity or poor lighting. However the incidence of 
real indoor pollution should not be ignored, it is surprisingly common. The construction 
quality of dwellings is improving with a resulting reduction of adventitious air infiltration 
producing fewer air changes. Inadequate ventilation, inefficient filtration and poor hygiene 
all contribute to poor indoor air quality.  
Carbon monoxide (CO) gas has no smell, taste or colour and it kills dozens of people in 
their homes every year. Many more suffer debilitating i llnesses often without anybody 
realising that they are being poisoned. CO gas is produced by combustion appliances 
such as fires, boilers and water heaters. Any appliance that burns solid fuel, gas or oil and 
that does not have a room -sealed balanced flue so that it is sealed off from the room, is 
capable of poisoning you if it is not properly installed, maintained and serviced. The 
highest incidence of CO poisoning occurs in domestic buildings.  
Oil accounts for about a third of all reported pollution incidents in Scotland that are 
investigated by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA). That means around 
500 to 600 pollution incidents a year with about 10 to 12% being serious. It is an offence to 
cause pollution and courts now impose heavy fines. Although domestic pollution is low 
compared with commercial and industrial buildings, it is important to ensure standards are 
not lowered.  
Disposal of wastewater and surface water also needs to be carefully considered to prevent 
environmental pollution and uncontrollable run- off during periods of heavy rainfall leading 
to flooding. The incorporation of water conservation measures in buildings can reduce 
################# - Page 175 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 175 Applicable from 5  June 2023   pressure on precious water resources by recycling water from certain types of appliance. 
Recycling can al so reduce the reliance on mains water and limit the amount of water 
discharged thus alleviating the risk of flooding. The inclusion of 'green roofs' into building 
design can also provide benefits to the environment and building owners alike. Although 
viewe d as mainly a vernacular building practice renewed interest is being shown in this 
technique due to the diverse benefits that can be achieved, such as:  
* run-off attenuation helps reduce sewer surcharging  
* absorbs greenhouse gases  
* absorbs air pollution  
* protects the roof finish from mechanical damage and ultra- violet radiation, and  
* provides additional insulation.  
Solid waste has increased enormously in the last couple of decades and disposal to land 
fill sites is creating severe problems. Recycl ing is now a priority.  
3.0.2  Aims  
The intention of this section is to ensure that, as far as is reasonably practicable, buildings 
do not pose a threat to the environment and dwellings, and people in or around buildings, 
are not placed at risk as a result of:  
a. site conditions  
b. hazardous and dangerous substances  
c. the effects of moisture in various forms  
d. an inadequate supply of air for human occupation of a building  
e. inadequate drainage from a building and from paved surfaces around a building  
f. inadequate and unsui table sanitary facilities  
g. inadequate accommodation and facilities in a dwelling  
h. inadequately constructed and installed combustion appliances  
i. inadequately constructed and installed oil storage tanks  
j. inadequate facilities for the storage and removal of solid waste from a dwelling.  
k. excessive heat gain in summer  months.  
3.0.3  Latest  changes  
The following is a summary of changes made to this section from 1 February 2023.  
* Standard 3.14 -  guidance on domestic ventilation provision  updated.  
* Standard 3.28 - new standard and supporting guidance on overheating introduced.  
* Annex 3.A - added to Handbook (previously separate 'Domestic Ventilation Guide').  
3.0.4  Relevant  legislation 
################# - Page 176 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 176 Applicable from 5  June 2023   Listed below are some pieces of legislation that may be relevant and/or helpful to those 
using the guidance in this particular section.  
The Gas Safety (Installations and Use) Regulations 1998 require that any person who 
installs, services, maintains, removes, or repairs gas fittings must be competent. It covers  
not only materials, workmanship, safety precautions and testing of gas fittings but also the 
safe installation of all aspects of gas -fired appliance installations.  
The Gas Appliance (Safety) Regulations 1995 cover all aspects of gas appliances and 
fitting s and sets safe standards to satisfy the essential requirements set by the EU. It sets 
procedures and duties for demonstrating attestation of conformity.  
The Control of Pollution Act 1974 covers, among others, duties and powers of the local 
authority to control and dispose of solid waste.  
The Environment Act 1995 covers, among others, duties and powers of the Scottish 
Environment Protection Agency.  
The Environmental Protection Act 1990 covers, among others, management and 
enforcement of the collection, disposal and treatment of waste, control of hazardous 
substances, oil pollution and nature conservation. Part IIA covers contaminated land.  
The Groundwater Regulations 1998 were introduced to prevent pollution of groundwater 
and to manage groundwater resources  in a sustainable way.  
The Water Environment and Water Services (Scotland) Act 2003 sets up an integrated 
regime for water quality and quantity management.  
The Water Byelaws apply to any water fitting installed or used in buildings where water is 
supplied by Scottish Water other than where specifically exempted.  
The Sewerage (Scotland) Act 1968 covers, among others, duties and powers of the local 
authority to provide, construct and maintain public sewers and rights of connection and 
discharge.  
The Water Env ironment (Controlled Activities)(Scotland) Regulations 2005 gives Ministers 
the power to introduce controls over a range of activities that have an adverse impact upon 
the water environment.  
The Water Environment (Oil Storage)(Scotland) Regulations 2006 were introduced to help 
reduce the incidence of oil pollution particularly from inadequate storage.  
3.0.5  Certification  
Scottish Ministers can, under Section 7 of the Building (Scotland) Act 2003, approve 
schemes for the certification of design or constructi on for compliance with the mandatory 
functional standards. Such schemes are approved on the basis that the procedures 
adopted by the scheme will take account of the need to co- ordinate the work of various 
designers and specialist contractors. Individuals approved to provide certification services 
under the scheme are assessed to ensure that they have the qualifications, skills and 
experience required to certify compliance for the work covered by the scope of the 
scheme. Checking procedures adopted by Approv ed Certifiers will deliver design or 
installation reliability in accordance with legislation.

3.1.0  Introduction 
Land contamination is an unwanted legacy of Britain's long industrial history. Part  IIA of 
the Environmental Protection Act 1990 (inserted by Section 57 of the Environment Act 
1995) was introduced to enable the identification and remediation of contaminated land 
from which contamination currently represents an unacceptable risk. Risks as sociated with 
the land's future use will continue to be dealt with under the planning and building 
standards system. Some functions of Part IIA, planning and building standards regimes 
may, at times, overlap.  
Public registers -  Part IIA adopts a 'suitable for use approach' that requires the current 
risks to be assessed and remediated as required, for a site's existing use. The primary 
regulatory role for this rests with the local authorities. Local authorities and SEPA must 
establish public regist ers to record all prescribed regulatory action taken under Part IIA. 
The register will contain particulars relating to the remediation, as well as notifications of 
the identification of contaminated land. The registers will expand as new information is 
identified.  
Section 78A(2) of the Act (as amended) provides a specific definition of 'contaminated 
land' for the purpose of the Act. Land that is not 'contaminated land' as defined under the 
Act may still contain harmful or dangerous substances and the follow ing guidance should 
be useful to the local authority in carrying out its other functions.  
Pan 33 -  land confirmed, or suspected of being contaminated is a material consideration 
when local authorities determine planning applications. The key role of the pl anning 
system is to ensure that all the ground included within the planning application is suitable 
for the proposed future use. Conditions may be added to any permission given to ensure 
the required remediation takes place. Planning Advice Note (PAN) 33 ' Development of 
Contaminated Land' explains further the role of planning and includes useful cross - 
references to other relevant publications and regimes.

substance, or mixt ure of substances, which is, or could become, corrosive, explosive, 
flammable, radioactive or toxic or which produces, or could produce, any gas likely to have 
any such characteristic.  
Conversions - in the case of conversions, as specified in regulation 4,  the building as 
converted shall meet the requirements of this standard in so far as is reasonably 
practicable, and in no case be worse than before the conversion (regulation 12, schedule 
6). 
3.1.1  Preparation of a  site 
Surface soil and vegetable matter ca n be detrimental to a buildings structure if left 
undisturbed within the building footprint. Therefore, before any work can commence, 
unsuitable material including turf, vegetable matter, wood, roots and topsoil should be 
removed from the ground to be covered by the building, and the ground immediately 
adjoining the building, to a depth of at least that which will prevent later growth that could 
damage the building. The term 'ground immediately adjoining' is intended to cover ground 
that is disturbed as a d irect result of the works.  
The solum (prepared area within the containing walls of a building) should be treated to 
prevent vegetable growth and reduce the evaporation of moisture from the ground to the 
inner surface of any part of a dwelling that it could damage.  
The solum should be brought to an even surface and any upfilling should be of hard, inert 
material. See guidance to Standard 3.4 relating to building elements adjacent to the 
ground.  
To prevent water collecting under the building, the solum should be not lower than the 
highest level of the adjoining ground. However where this may not be possible, such as on 
sloping ground, the solum should be laid to fall to an outlet in the underbuilding above the 
lowest level of the adjoining ground to prevent any water build up below the building.  
Any part of the underbuilding that is in contact with the ground, such as on sloping ground, 
should be tanked see clause 3.4.7.  
Where the site contains fill or made ground, consideration should be given to its 
compressi bility and its collapse potential. Thought should be given to foundation design to 
prevent the damaging effect of differential settlement.  
3.1.2  Harmful or dangerous  substances  
For the purposes of this Technical Handbook, clause 3.1.0 provides guidance on what 
harmful or dangerous substances may consist of. Because of their hazardous qualities, 
any ground below and immediately adjoining (see clause 3.1.1) a building should have 
them removed or made safe. Guidance on remedial action to deal with such substances is 
given in clause 3.1.5.  
3.1.3  Hazard identification and  assessment  
A preliminary desk -top study should be carried out to provide information on the past and 
present uses of the proposed building site and surrounding area that may give rise to 
################# - Page 179 -  ##################

Page 179 Applicable from 5  June 2023   contami nation. Examples of land likely to contain contaminants can include, but are not 
limited to:  
* asbestos works  
* chemical works  
* gas works, coal carbonisation plants and ancillary by -products works  
* industries making or using wood preservatives  
* landfill and other  waste disposal sites  
* metal mines, smelters, foundries, steel works and metal finishing works  
* munitions production and testing sites  
* nuclear installations  
* oil storage and distribution sites  
* paper and printing works  
* railway land, especially the larger sidin gs and depots  
* scrap yards  
* sewage works, sewage farms and sludge disposal sites  
* tanneries, and  
* petrol filling stations.  
During a walk -over of the area there may be signs of possible contaminants. The 
preliminary investigation can assist in the design of the exploratory and detailed ground 
investigation. A detailed ground investigation may be necessary and should provide 
sufficient information for the risk assessment and the design and specification of any 
remedial work.  
Risk assessment should be specific to each building site and take into account the 
presence of source, pathways and receptors at a particular building site. Generic 
assessment criteria may provide an indication of where further consideration of risk to 
receptors is required. The selection of assessment criteria should take into account the 
specific circumstances of the building site and the receptors that may be exposed.  
Assessment criteria should be authoritative and scientifically based. Should a risk be 
indicated then further consideration would be warranted. This may involve collection and 
assessment of further information. Useful tools for undertaking detailed assessment of risk 
are available e.g. CONSIM and CLEA. Reference should be made to SEPA  and DEFRA  
web sites which contain details of published and forthcoming guidance.  
The Environment A gency  (EA) manages an extensive research programme related to land 
contamination. This programme is ongoing and a check should be made to ensure that the 
most up- to-date guidance is used. The following are just some of t he publications that may 
be of interest:

development of soil guideline values: CLR 7

3.1.4  Development on land that may be  contaminated  
Where the desk study, records or local knowledge of previous use identifies, land that may 
contain, or give rise to, harmful or dangerous substances, planning permission will 
normally be subject to conditions. These conditions may be imposed to ensure that the 
development proposed for the land will not expose future users or occupiers, or any 
building or services, to hazards associated with the contaminants.  
3.1.5  Land not initially identified as being contaminated  
There may be occasions when land containi ng harmful or dangerous substances has not 
been identified at the planning stage, and the presence of contaminants is only suspected 
later. Some signs of the possible presence of contaminants are given in the table below 
together with the possible contaminant and the probable remedial action recommended.  
The verifier may require the removal or treatment of any of the contaminants in the table to 
clause 3.1.5, to be carried out by specialists.  
If any signs of possible contaminants are present, the verifier s hould be told at once. If the 
presence of any of the contaminants listed in the table to clause 3.1.5 is confirmed, it is 
likely that some form of remedial action will be required. For guidance, the normal course 
of remedial action is listed against each c ontaminant. In all cases these courses of action 
assume that the ground to be covered by the building will have at least 100 mm of in- situ 
concrete cover. Expert advice may be required to provide an economical and safe solution 
to the hazards encountered especially where contaminants are present in large amounts or 
where there is imminent danger to health or safety.

3.1.6  Risk management  techniques  
The Construction Industry Research and Information Association (CIRIA) produces many 
useful guidance documents on the application of different risk management techniques.  
There are a range of options for managing the risk of contamination. This can include 
removal or treatment of the contaminant source or breaking the pathway by which 
contaminants can present a risk to receptors:  
Removal - means that the contaminant itself and any contaminated ground to be covered 
by the building should be taken out to a depth of 1 m (or less if the verifier agrees) below 
the level of the lowest floor. The contaminant should then be taken away to a place to be 
named by the local authority  
Filling - means that the ground to be covered by the building should be determined on a 
site specific basis but is normally to a depth of 1 m (or less if the verifier agrees) with a 
material which will not react adversel y with any contaminant remaining and may be used 
for making up levels. The type of filling and the design of the ground floor should be 
considered together  
################# - Page 182 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 182 Applicable from 5  June 2023   Inert filling -  means that the filling is wholly non -combustible and not easily changed by 
chemical reactions  
Sealing - means that a imperforate barrier is laid between the contaminant and the 
building and sealed at the joints, around the edges and at the service entries. Note that 
polyethylene may not be suitable if the contaminant is a liquid such as a tarry waste or 
organic solvent  
Ground treatment -  may provide a more cost effective and environmentally sustainable 
solution. Treatment may be the only option where the presence of structures or services 
prevents excavation. Treatment processes can be biological, chemical or physical and be 
undertaken either in- situ (contaminants are treated in the ground) or ex -situ (contaminated 
material is excavated and then treated before being returned). The processes convert the 
contaminant into a neutral form or ren der it harmless. There are also solidification and 
stabilisation processes that can 'fix' contaminants in the soil so as to reduce the harm, and 
thermal processes that alter the contaminant by incineration or by volatilisation. The exact 
process to use wil l depend on the contaminant present and the soil type. Expert advice 
should be sought.  
CIRIA  and the EA websites also contain useful data sheets on remedial treatment options.  
3.1.7  Housing on land affected by  contamination  
The National House Building Council  (NHBC), together with the Environment Agency, has 
produced a guidance document 'Guidance for the Safe Development of Housing on Land 
Affected by Contamination'. The document aims to promote the adoption of good practice 
in the identification, investigation, assessment and remedial treatment of land affected by 
contamination, so that the development of housing on such land can be undertaken safely 
and with confidence that no unacceptable risks remain.  
3.1.8  Re-development of industrial  land 
With the increasing re- development of former industrial land, attention is also drawn to BS 
10175: 2001, 'Investigation of potentially contaminated sites, Code of Practice'. The British 
Standard provides guidance on, and recommendations for, the investigation of land that 
may be contaminated or land with naturally enhanced concentrations of potentially  harmful 
materials, to determine or manage the ensuing risk. BS 5930: 1999, 'Code of Practice for 
Site Investigations' is also relevant. This CoP deals with the investigation of ground for the 
purpose of assessing their suitability for the construction of the work. It provides 
recommendations on certain constraints or problems that can affect a site, such as 
geotechnical aspects and the legal aspects including the need for licenses or permits.  
3.1.9  Risks to construction materials and  services  
Buildings, an d the materials they are constructed from, are classed as receptors and 
therefore may be subject to damage if they come into contact with contaminated land. A 
principal concern is that any attack or damage from ground contaminants may affect the 
structural  integrity or serviceability of the building and present a health and safety threat.  
Both natural and human generated ground conditions can be aggressive to structures and 
services, in view of this the construction design should take account of any ground 
contaminants that could affect or damage buildings, materials and services. In practice it 
################# - Page 183 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 183 Applicable from 5  June 2023   may be more difficult to assess and manage contamination risks when dealing with new 
work to existing buildings.  
Site analysis and hazard identification are necessar y to allow assessment of any 
contamination risks posed to the construction. The susceptibility of construction to 
aggressive contaminant attack generally depends on four conditions:  
* presence of water  
* contaminant concentrations  
* contact between materials and contaminants, and  
* material sensitivity.  
 
The BRE publication BR 255:1994 'Performance of Building Materials in Contaminated 
Land' provides detailed guidance on the vulnerability of building materials to the hazards 
arising from contamination.  
The following table identifies some common aggressive substances, their possible effects 
on building materials and possible mitigation options.

Page 184 Applicable from 5  June 2023   3.2 Site preparation -  protection from radon gas 
Mandatory Standard  
Standard 3.2  
Every building must be designed and constructed in such a way that there will 
not be a threat to the health of people in or around the building due to the 
emission and containment of radon gas.  
 
 
3.2.0  Introduction 
Radon is a naturally occurring, radioactive, colourless and odourless gas that is formed 
where uranium and radium are present. It can move through cracks and fissures in the 
subsoil, and so into buildings. The amount, or activity, of radon is measured in becquerels 
(Bq). Where this gas occurs under a dwelling, the external walls contain it and the 
containment of radon can build up inside the dwelling over the long term posing a risk to 
health.  
Breathing in radon gas for long periods increases the risk of developing lu ng cancer and 
since people spend a high proportion of their time at home, concentration levels in 
dwellings are very important. Although the risk is relatively insignificant for people visiting 
or living for short periods in a dwelling with high levels of radon, long -term exposure can 
increase the risk to the point where preventative action is necessary. To reduce the risk, all 
new dwellings, extensions and alterations, built in areas where there might be radon 
concentration, may need to incorporate protect ive measures.  
Public Health England (PHE), formally the Health Protection Agency, is the primary 
resource for advice about radon in the UK, and recommends that radon levels in homes 
should be reduced if the average is more than 200 becquerels per cubic met re (Bq/m3). 
Further information relating to radon levels, testing, sources and effects can be accessed 
on the PHE's "UKradon" website at http://www.ukradon.org/ . 
Conversions - in the case of conversions, as specified in regulation 4, the building as 
converted shall meet the requirements of this standard in so far as is reasonably 
practicable, and in no case be worse than before the conversion. (regulation 12, schedule 
6). 
3.2.1  Radon probability  areas  
"Radon probability areas" have been designated by testing dwellings. Where tests on 
existing dwellings show that 1% of the dwellings in that area are likely to have a radon 
concentration above 200 Bq/m3 (the action lev el) the area is designated as a 'radon 
probability area'.  
Radon maps -  The Health Protection Agency (HPA) (now Public Health England (PHE)) 
and the British Geological Society jointly worked on detailing mapping in Scotland of radon 
potential. The report pr oviding an overview of this work, titled "Indicative Atlas of Radon in 
Scotland", was published in July 2011 and is available to view or download from PHE's 
################# - Page 185 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 185 Applicable from 5  June 2023   "UKradon" website http://www.ukradon.org/. The resulting high definition digital map 
indicates areas in Scotland with elevated radon potential. The map provides an indicative 
picture of areas of the country where radon levels are likely to be higher.  
Radon risk report -  the atlas presented in the report contains simplified maps that are 
indicative rather that definitive with each 1km grid square coloured according to the 
highest radon potential found within it. A risk report giving the estimated radon potential for 
an individual dwelling or site can be obtained through the "UKradon" website http:// 
www.u kradon.org/.  
3.2.2  Protection from radon gas 
If a dwelling is to be located or extended on ground designated as a 'radon probability 
area', or on ground where radon is known to exist, protective work should be undertaken 
to prevent excessive radon gas from  entering the dwelling.  
Radon protective measures should be provided in accordance with the guidance contained 
in BRE publication BR 211 - 'Radon: guidance on protective measures for new buildings'.  
Additional guidance on the installation of radon protecti on measures in dwellings is 
available in two BRE Good Building Guides; GG 73 "Radon protection for new domestic 
extensions and conservatories with solid concrete ground floors" and GG 74 "Radon 
protection for dwellings". Both of these publications should b e read in conjunction with BR 
211.

Page 186 Applicable from 5  June 2023   3.3 Flooding and  groundwater  
Mandatory Standard  
Standard 3.3  
Every building must be designed and constructed in such a way that there will 
not be a threat to the building or the health of the occupants as a result of 
flooding and the accumulation of groundwater.  
 
 
3.3.0  Introduction 
Flooding can be diverse, often site specific and brought about by a range of factors 
including heavy rain, raised groundwater levels, increased rain water run- off and blocked 
or surcharged dr ainage systems. It is also generally recognised that climate change may 
play a major role in increasing the risk of flooding in the future, for example, local pluvial 
(rainfall) flooding from more frequent short intense rain storms.  
The effects of flooding on a building can include significant damage to materials, services 
and structure. Contamination could result where waste water drainage is present in the 
floodwater. Where there is a risk that flooding can affect a building it is important that any 
proposed construction is designed to be more resistant or resilient.  
Pressure for land development may mean that development may be given planning 
approval on land subject to some risk of flooding. Where development is to take place on 
land assessed by the planning authority as having a flood risk, advice should be sought 
from sources such as the local planning authority, the Scottish Environment Protection 
Agency (SEPA) and those responsible for coastal defences. Further guidance may be 
obtained from the 'Scott ish Planning Policy SPP.  
The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) provides flood risk information on 
their indicative river and coastal interactive flood maps on their website -  
http://www.sepa.org.uk/ . 
When near surface level groundwater is present on a building site there is the potential  for 
construction activity to affect it or for the groundwater to pose a hazard to any new 
buildings. To reduce the risk to buildings from  groundwater, subsoil drainage of a site may 
be necessary to protect against penetration of groundwater through a building and 
damage to the building fabric. Any existing drains that will be affected by the construction 
of a building should also continue t o function properly and guidance is provided under 
Standard 3.5.  
Conversions - in the case of conversions, as specified in regulation 4, the building as 
converted shall meet the requirements of this standard in so far as is reasonably 
practicable, and in no case be worse than before the conversion (regulation 12, schedule 
6).

Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 187 Applicable from 5  June 2023   3.3.1  Groundwater 
New building sites should be initially assessed to establish the existing groundwater level 
and any fluctuation to the established level brought about by seasonal effect, new 
construction, excavations or other related activities.  
Ground below and immediately adjoining a dwelling that is liable to accumulate 
groundwater, at a level that could affect the structure or penetrate the building, requires 
subsoil drainage or other dewatering treatment to be provided to mitigate against the 
harmful effects of such water.  
The drainage of groundwater may also be necessary for the following reasons:  
* to increase the stability of the ground  
* to avoid surface flooding  
* to alleviate subsoil water pressures likely to cause dampness to below -ground 
accommodation  
* to assist in preventing damage to foundations of  buildings  
* to prevent frost heave of subsoil that could cause fractures to structures such as 
concrete slabs.  
The selection of an appropriate drainage layout will depend on the nature of the subsoil 
and the topography of the ground. Field drains, where provided, should be laid in 
accordance with the recommendations in clause 10 of BS 8301: 1985.  
Surface water run -off to adjacent sites -  with the removal of topsoil from a development 
site, developers should be aware of the dangers from possible surface water run- off from 
their building site to other properties. It is good practice to have procedures in place to 
overcome this occurrence. Depending on conditions, the formation of channels or small 
dams to divert the run- off or, where conditions are particularly serious, the installation of 
field drains or rubble drains may overcome the problem.  
3.3.2  Flood risk  assessm ent 
Any identified site specific risk of flooding to a building or its occupants should be 
assessed to allow sustainable design mitigation. Building site flood risk assessments 
should be an integral part of the design and construction process with the appr aisal also 
considering the effects that the development may have on adjoining ground.  
'Planning and Building Standards Advice on Flooding'  (PAN 69) sets out flood risk 
and probability assessment procedures including the need for drainage assessments to 
demonstrate a neutral or better effect on sites where flooding is an issue. For site specific 
flood risk assessments the CIRIA document 'Development and Flood Risk -  guidance for 
the construction industry' (C624) 2004 provides detailed guidance on carrying out flood 
risk assessment and suggests design considerations for developers.  
3.3.3  Resilient construction in flood risk  areas  
Where it is intended to develop in areas that may be at some identified risk of flooding, 
buildings should be designed and constructed to offer a level of flood resistance and 
resilience that can reduce the flood impact on structure and materials.  
################# - Page 188 -  ##################

Page 188 Applicable from 5  June 2023   The May 2007 CIRIA document 'Improving the Flood Performance of New Buildings -  
Flood Resilient Construction' is a national document that provides design guidance on 
suitable materials and construction details for use in low or residual flood risk 
developments.

likely effects of flooding on materials  and elements of the building and assesses various 
forms of construction and measures to reduce the risk of flood damage in dwellings.

Page 189 Applicable from 5  June 2023   3.4 Moisture from the  ground  
Mandatory Standard  
Standard 3.4  
Every building must be designed and constructed in such a way that there will 
not be a threat to the building or the health of the occupants as a result of 
moisture penetration from the ground.  
 
 
3.4.0  Introduction 
Water is the prime cause of deterioration  in building materials and constructions and the 
presence of moisture encourages growth of mould that is injurious to health. Ground water 
can penetrate building fabric from below, rising vertically by capillary action. The effects of 
this rising damp are immediately recognisable. There may be horizontal 'tidemarks' 
sometimes several feet above the floor; below it the wall is discoloured with general 
darkening and patchiness. There may also be loose wallpaper, signs of mould growth and 
deterioration of plas ter. Hygroscopic salts brought up from the ground tend to concentrate 
in the 'tidemark'.  
Dwellings therefore need to be constructed in such a way that rising damp neither 
damages the building fabric nor penetrates to the interior where it may constitute a health 
risk to occupants.  
Designers should be aware of the impact that climate change could have on the fabric of 
buildings through increased rainfall and temperatures. Higher wind speeds and driving rain 
should focus attention to improved design and quali ty of construction and to the protection 
of the building fabric from long term dampness.  
Conversions - in the case of conversions, as specified in regulation 4, the building as 
converted shall meet the requirements of this standard in so far as is reasonably 
practicable, and in no case be worse than before the conversion (regulation 12, schedule 
6). 
3.4.1  Treatment of building elements adjacent to the ground 
A floor, wall or other building element adjoining the ground should prevent moisture from 
the ground reaching the inner surface of any part of a dwelling that it could damage.  
Floors, walls or other building elements adjoining the ground should be constructed in 
accordance with the following recommendations. The dimensions specified are the 
minimum recom mended; greater dimensions may therefore be used.

Page 192 Applicable from 5  June 2023   3.5 Existing  drains  
Mandatory Standard  
Standard 3.5  
Every building must not be constructed over an existing drain (including a field 
drain) that is to remain active.  
Limitation:  
This standard does not apply where it is not reasonably practicable to re- route 
an existing drain.  
 
 
3.5.0  Introduction 
The purpose of this standard is to ensure that existing drains continue to function properly 
without causing harm to the building or to the health of the occupants.  
Generally, public sewers are not permitted beneath buildings. Where it is proposed to 
construct a building over the line of an existing sewer, the sewer should be re-routed 
around the building. Permission will be required from the Water Authority for any work that 
is to be carried out to a public sewer.  
In exceptional circumstances, if it not possible to re- route an existing sewer away from the 
dwelling, for instance if a gap building site in a terrace is being developed, the Water 
Authority may permit a building to be constructed over an existing public sewer. Where it is 
necessary to build over a public sewer, approval of the Water Authority will be required.  
Disused drains and sewers offer ideal harbourage to rats and frequently offer a route for 
them to move between the drains and the surface. They can also collapse causing 
subsidence.  
Conversions - in the case of conversions, as specified in regul ation 4, the building as 
converted shall meet the requirement of this standard (regulation 12, schedule 6).  
3.5.1  Existing  drains  
A survey should be carried out to establish the geography and topography of the building 
site and ascertain whether there are any existing field drains. Where a building site 
requires that an existing drain (including a field drain) must remain active and be re-  routed 
or retained, particular methods of construction and protection should be carefully 
considered. The guidance cont ained in clauses 3.5.2, 3.5.3 and 3.5.4 should be taken into 
account and any new drain should be constructed in accordance with the guidance to 
Standards 3.6 and/or 3.7.  
3.5.2  Re-routing of  drains  
Where a building is erected over a private drain, including a field drain that is to remain 
active, the drain should be re- routed if reasonably practicable or re- constructed in a 
manner appropriate to the conditions of the site.  
################# - Page 193 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 193 Applicable from 5  June 2023   3.5.3  Re-construction of  drains  
The condition of any private drain or sewer that is to  be built over should be determined. If 
in poor condition and/or relatively shallow then consideration should be given to re-
construction if re- routing is not reasonably practicable.  
The strength of a pipeline should be determined, decided or specified bef ore construction 
work is undertaken. Drains should be designed and constructed in accordance with the 
recommendations in BS EN 752- 3: 1997 and BS EN 1295- 1: 1998. During construction, it 
should be ensured that the assumptions made in the design are safeguarded or adapted 
to changed conditions.  
Protection of drains -  every drain or sewer should be protected from damage by 
construction traffic and heavy machinery. Providing barriers to keep such traffic away from 
the line of the drain or sewer may be appropriate. Heavy materials should not be stored 
over drains or sewers.  
It is recommended that manholes are not located within a dwelling.  
3.5.4  Drains passing through  structures  
Where a drain or sewer passes through a structure, including a manhole or inspection 
chamber, a detail should be devised to allow sufficient flexibility to avoid damage of the 
pipe due to movement. A rigid connection however may be appropriate if the drain or 
sewer and the structure are an integral construction on a rigid foundati on. Where drains 
pass under or close to structures, similar precautions should be considered. Drains or 
sewers should be constructed and laid in accordance with the recommendations of BS EN 
1610: 1998.  
3.5.5  Sealing disused drains  
Sewers or drains provide ideal nesting places for rats. In order to prevent this, they should 
be disconnected from the drainage system as near as possible to the point of connection. 
This should be done in a manner that does not damage any pipe that is still in use and 
ensures tha t the sewer system is watertight. This may be carried out, for example, by 
removing the pipe from a junction and placing a stopper in the branch of the junction fitting. 
Where the connection is to a public sewer, the Water Authority should be consulted.  
Sewers and drains less than 1.5 m from the surface and in open ground should be, as far 
as reasonably practicable, removed. Other pipes should be capped at both ends and at 
any point of connection, to ensure rats cannot gain entry.

Page 194 Applicable from 5  June 2023   3.6 Surface water  drain age 
Mandatory Standard  
Standard 3.6  
Every building, and hard surface within the curtilage of a building, must be 
designed and constructed with a surface water drainage system that will:  
a) ensure the disposal of surface water without threatening the building 
and the health and safety of the people in or around the building, and  
b) have facilities for the separation and removal of silt, grit and pollutants.  
 
 
3.6.0  Introduction 
Climate change is expected to result in more rain in the future and it is essential that this is 
taken into account in buildings. It is essential that the surface water from buildings is 
removed safely without damage to the building, danger to people around the building and 
does not pose a risk to the environment by flooding or poll ution.  
Development of building sites generally leads to increased impermeable areas that can 
significantly increase the amount of surface water run- off to be dealt with. The approach to 
the disposal of surface water from buildings and hard surfaces clearly  needs to be 
considered at the earliest stage in the design and development process (see also the 
Scottish Executive Development Department's Planning Advice Note No. PAN 61 -  
Planning and Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems).  
For safety reasons it is essen tial that surface water is not permitted to collect or remain on 
all access routes to buildings, particularly with elderly and disabled people in mind. 
Ponding in winter can cause slippery surfaces that can be a hazard to pedestrians.  
Controlled activities - the discharge of surface water is a controlled activity under The 
Water Environment (Controlled Activities) (Scotland) Regulations 2005. Under these 
regulations surface water discharges to ground or water (wetlands, surface waters or 
groundwater) must be by means of a sustainable urban drainage system authorised by 
The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA). Surface water discharge from a 
single dwelling or its curtilage is permitted to be by other means.  
In some localities there is growing pressure on water resources due to changes in the 
climate and increasing expectations of personal hygiene. The introduction of conservation 
measures, such as the collection of surface water for its reuse is strongly encouraged to 
reduce the reliance on mains wat er. 
Explanation of terms: Paved surface - means any constructed hard surface more than 
50 m2. 
Conversions - in the case of conversions, as specified in regulation 4, the buildings as 
converted shall meet the requirements of this standard (regulation 12, sc hedule 6).

Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 195 Applicable from 5  June 2023   3.6.1  Surface water drainage from  dwellings  
Every building should be provided with a drainage system to remove rainwater from the 
roof, or other areas where rainwater might accumulate, without causing damage to the 
structure or endangering the health and safety of people in and around the building.  
Where gutters and rainwater pipes are used, they should be constructed and installed in 
accordance with the recommendations described in BS EN 12056- 3: 2000.  
Eaves drop systems - methods other than gutters and rainwater pipes may be utilised to 
remove rainwater from roofs. An eaves drop system will allow rainwater to drop freely to 
the ground. Where these are used, they should be designed taking into account the 
following:  
* the existing groundwater level and ground infiltration capacity  
* the protection of the fabric of the dwelling from ingress of water caused by water 
splashing on the wall  
* the need to prevent water from entering doorways and windows  
* the need to protect persons from falling water when around the dwelling 
* the need to protect persons and the building fabric from rainwater splashing on the 
ground or forming ice on access routes. The provision of a gravel layer or angled 
concrete apron or such like may be acceptable 
* the protection of the bu ilding foundations from concentrated discharges from  gutters.  
Gutters and rainwater pipes may be omitted from a roof at any height provided it has an 
area of not more than 8 m2 and no other area drains onto it.  
3.6.2  Surface water drainage of paved  surfaces  
Every domestic building should be provided with a drainage system to remove surface 
water from paved surfaces, such as an access route that is suitable for disabled people, 
without endangering the building or the health and safety of people in and around the 
building. The paved surface should be so laid as to ensure rainwater run- off is not close to 
the building. Paved surface drainage systems should be designed, constructed and 
installed, either:  
a. incorporating SUD system techniques as in clause 3.6.4, or  
b. using a traditional piped drainage system as in clause 3.6.8.  
3.6.3  Surface water  discharge 
Surface water discharged from a domestic building and a hard surface within the curtilage 
of a domestic building should be carried to a point of disposal that will not endanger the 
building, environment or the health and safety of people around the building.  
Surface water discharge should be to:  
a. a storage container with an overflow discharging to any of the 4 following options, or  
b. a SUD system designed and const ructed in accordance with clause 3.6.4,  or 
c. a soakaway constructed in accordance with: 
################# - Page 196 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 196 Applicable from 5  June 2023   * clause 3.6.5, or  
* the guidance in BRE Digest 365, 'Soakaway Design', or  
* National Annex NA 4 of BS EN 752: 2008, or  
d. a public  sewer provided under the Sewerage (Scotland) Act 1968, or  
e. an outfall to a watercourse, such as a river, stream or loch or coastal waters, that 
complies with any notice and/or consent by SEPA.  
Discharge from a soakaway should not endanger the stability of the building. Damage to 
the foundations is likely to occur where discharge is too close to the building and it is 
sensible to ensure that any water bearing strata directs water away from the building.  
Location of soakaway -  to prevent such damage therefore, every part of a soakaway 
should be located at least 5 m from a building and from a boundary in order that an 
adjoining plot is not inhibited from its full development potential. However the volume of 
surface water run- off, ground strata or permeability of the soil may influence this dimension 
and it may be reduced, or indeed may need to be increased, to preserve the structural 
integrity of the building.  
3.6.4  Sustainable Urban Drainage  Systems 
Sustainable urban drainage (SUD) is a concept that focuses dec isions about drainage on 
the environment and people. The concept takes account of the quantity and quality of 
surface water run- off and the amenity value of surface water in the urban environment.  
The variety of design options available allows designers an d planners to consider local 
land use, land take, future management and the needs of local people. SUD systems often 
stretch beyond the confines of the curtilage of individual buildings but need to be 
considered as a whole.  
Fundamental to a successful SUD system is a management train that allows for a range of 
components to be incorporated for control or management of surface water, such as:  
* Source Control -  control of run- off at or very near its source by components including 
soakaways, other infiltration methods, green roofs or permeable surfaces.  
* Site Control -  management of surface water within a building site by components 
including large soakaways, infiltration systems or detention basins.  
* Regional Control -  management of surface water from building si tes by components 
including balancing ponds and wetlands.  
SUD systems range from the use of basic components such as permeable materials that 
allow surface water to infiltrate to ground in a way that can mimic natural drainage to more 
complex engineered components including filter strips, swales, or wet ponds that will 
convey or store surface water. The CIRIA  document C753 'The SUDS Manual' 2015 
provides comprehensive advice on initial dr ainage design assessments and best practice 
guidance on the planning, design, construction, operation and maintenance of SUD 
systems.  
Careful consideration should be given to the design of surface water drainage from 
brownfield land, particularly where contamination might be expected. SEPA  provides 
guidance in their SUDS Advice Note -  'Brownfield Sites'.  
################# - Page 197 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 197 Applicable from 5  June 2023   Generally SUD systems are designed to utilise natural processes and regular monit oring 
and maintenance will be needed to ensure the system as conceived is operating as 
intended.  
3.6.5  Soakaway single dwellings and  extensions  
Soakaways have been the traditional method of disposal of surface water from buildings 
and paved areas where no mains drainage exists. A soakaway serving a single dwelling or 
an extension should be designed and constructed in accordance with the following 
guidance:  
a. test the suitability of the ground in accordance with the percolation test method in 
clause 3.9.1. The trial holes and the finished soakaways should be a minimum of 5 m 
from the dwelling and the boundary. However this dimension may be reduced slightly 
on small sites where ground conditions allow, such as very well draining soil  
b. there should be individual s oakaways for each dwelling.  
The soakaways may be sized using the following simplified formulae derived from BRE 
Digest 365:  
(A x 0.0145) - (a x f x 900) = S  
Where - A is the area to be drained in m2.  
a - is the internal surface area of the soakaway to 50% effective depth, excluding the base 
in m2. This has to be assumed for initial calculation purposes.  
f - is the soil infiltration rate, in m/s, determined in accordance with clause 3.9.1. This 
calculation produces Vp in secs/mm [conversion = (1/Vp) /1000].  
S - is the required storage in m3.  
3.6.6  Surface water run -off from small paved  areas  
Free draining surface water run- off may be appropriate for small hard surface areas, such 
as access paths. Free draining run- off can be achieved by laying the sur face to a fall, 
sufficient to avoid ponding, that allows the water to drain to a pervious area, such as 
grassland, provided the infiltration capacity of the ground is not overloaded. Also the 
discharge should not be adjacent to the building where it could damage the  foundations.  
3.6.7  Rainwater  harvesting  
Rainwater harvesting systems allow surface water run- off from dwellings or hardstanding 
areas to be collected, stored and distributed thereby reducing the demand for potable 
water, the load on drainage systems and surface water run- off that can lead to incidents of 
flooding. The re- use of surface water can produce benefits to the home owner and the 
environment and therefore is recommended.  
Rain, as it falls on buildings, is soft, clear and largely free of contaminants. During 
collection and storage however there is potential for contamination. For this reason it is 
recommended that recycled surface water is used only for flushing water closets, car 
washing and garden taps as it is not possible to guarantee the necessary maintenance of 
complex filters that would be essential if it were used for consumption or personal hygiene.  
 
################# - Page 198 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 198 Applicable from 5  June 2023   Manufacturers of proprietary systems or guidance documents such as CIRIA C539 or 
'Harvesting Rainwater for domestic use: an information guide' published by the 
Environment Agency  provides helpful guidance on design considerations.  
Where a rainwater harvesting system is to be installed it should be designed, constructed 
and installed in accordance with the Water Byelaws 2004, the recommendations of the 
Water Regulations Advisory Scheme (WRAS) Information and Guidance Notes No. 9- 02-
04 and 9- 02-05, 1999 and the CIRIA publication CIRIA C539; 'R ainwater and greywater 
use in buildings', provide good practice installation, design and maintenance advice. The 
approval of Scottish Water is needed before any such scheme is installed.  
Filtration - prior to the storage of water in a tank the rainwater should be filtered to remove 
leaves and other organic matter and dust or grit. Disinfection may be required if the 
catchment area is likely to be contaminated with animal faeces, extensive bird droppings, 
oils or soil.  
Water storage tanks should be construct ed of materials such as GRP, high- density 
polyethylene, steel or concrete and sealed and protected against the corrosive effects of 
the stored water and to prevent the ingress of ground water if located underground.  
Water for use in the dwelling should be extracted from just below the water surface in the 
tank to provide optimum water quality. All pipework carrying rainwater for use in the 
dwelling should be identified as such in accordance with the WRAS guidance notes and 
great care should be taken to avoi d cross- connecting reclaimed water and mains water.  
Tanks should be accessible to allow for internal cleaning and the maintenance of inlet 
valves, sensors, filters or submersible pumps. An overflow should discharge to a soakaway 
(see guidance to Standard 3 .6) or to mains drainage where it is not reasonably practicable 
to discharge to a soakaway. Backflow prevention devices should be incorporated to 
prevent contaminated water from entering the system.  
3.6.8  Traditional drainage  systems  
There can be substanti al advantages from the use of SUD systems, but where a traditional 
piped system is required it should be designed and constructed in accordance with the 
guidance in National Annex of BS EN 752: 2008.  
3.6.9  Discharges into a drainage  system  
Where a discharg e into a traditional drainage system contains silt or grit, for example from 
a hard standing with car wash facilities, there should be facilities for the separation of such 
substances. Removable grit interceptors should be incorporated into the surface wat er 
gully pots to trap the silt or grit.  
3.6.10  Testing  
A surface water drainage system should be tested to ensure the system is laid and is 
functioning correctly. Testing should be carried out in accordance with the guidance in BS 
EN 1610: 1998.

Mandatory Standard  
Standard 3.7  
Every wastewater drainage system serving a building must be designed and 
constructed in such a way as to ensure the removal of wastewater from the 
building without threatening the health and safety of people in or around the 
building, and:  
a) that facilities for the separation and removal of oil, fat, grease and 
volatile substances from the system are provided  
b) that discharge is to a public sewer or public wastewater treatment 
plant, where it is reasonably practicable to do so, and  
c) where discharge to a public sewer or public wastewater treatment plant 
is not reasonably practicable that discharge is to a private wastewater 
treatment plant or septic tank.  
Limitation:  
Standard 3.7(a) does not apply t o a dwelling.  
 
 
3.7.0  Introduction 
This guidance applies to wastewater systems that operate essentially under gravity. The 
guidance to this standard provides recommendations for the design, construction and 
installation of drains and sewers from a building to the point of connection to a public 
sewer or public sewage treatment works.  
The guidance should also be used for all pipework connecting to a private wastewater 
treatment plant or septic tank.  
Guidance on private wastewater treatment plants, septic tanks and infiltration fields is 
provided to Standards 3.8 and 3.9.  
Combined sewers -  some sewers, called combined sewers, carry wastewater and 
surface water in the same pipe. It may be appropriate to install a drainage system within 
the curtilage of a buildi ng as a separate system even when the final connection is to a 
combined sewer. This will facilitate the upgrading of the combined sewer at a later date.  
Incorrect connections - the connection of wastewater drains to surface water drains is a 
common occurre nce during conversions and extensions in urban areas served by 
separate drainage systems. Incorrect connections can cause chronic and severe pollution 
of watercourses and a careful check should be made before final connection is made to 
the appropriate drain.  
Conversions - in the case of conversions, as specified in regulation 4, the building as 
converted shall meet the requirements of this standard (regulation 12, schedule 6).

Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 200 Applicable from 5  June 2023   3.7.1  Sanitary pipework  
Differences in plumbing within Europe have led to a variety of systems being developed. 
These have happened as a result of differences in the type and use of sanitary appliances 
in Member States. The European Standards describe the 4 main systems in use but it is 
expected that traditional practices will continue in the various countries. However care will 
need to be taken if different systems are used to ensure that the entire system operates 
satisfactorily and that the system designed and installed is compatible with, and suitable 
for, connection to existing wastewater systems.  
Sanitary pipework should be constructed and installed in accordance with the 
recommendations in BS EN 12056- 2: 2000. The BS EN describes 4 different systems as 
follows:  
* System III (single discharge stack system with full bore branch discharge pipes) as 
described in Clause 4.2 of BS EN 12056- 2: 2000 is the traditional system in use in the 
UK. 
* However low water and energy consumption is now a major consideration in any 
design solution. With this in mind, System II (single discharge stack  system with small 
bore discharge branch pipes) may be appropriate. Careful consideration should be 
given to the design of the system where a low flush cistern is connected to an existing 
drain to ensure that blockages do not occur as a result of reduced f low rates.  
* Systems I (single discharge stack system with partially filled branch discharge pipes) 
and IV (separate discharge stack system) have developed as a result of different types 
of sanitary appliances and technical traditions in the various European countries. 
These system types are unlikely to be appropriate for use in this country.  
Reducing the bore of a pipe in the direction of flow may lead to blockages and should not 
be considered as an acceptable method of construction. However sanitary pipewor k may 
be reduced where it is connected to a pump installed in compliance with the conditions of 
certification by a notified body. These pumped systems are generally in use where  the 
appliances are located in basement levels below the flood level of the drain. (see clause 
3.7.2).  
3.7.2  Sanitary appliances below flood level  
The basements of approximately 500 buildings in Scotland are flooded each year when 
the sewers surcharge (the effluent runs back up the pipes because they are too small to 
take the required flow). Wastewater from sanitary appliances and floor gullies below flood 
level should be drained by wastewater lifting plants or, where there is unlikely to be a risk 
to persons such as in a car park, via an anti -flooding device. Wastewater lifting plant s 
should be constructed in accordance with BS EN 12056- 4: 2000. Wastewater from 
sanitary appliances above flood level should not be drained through anti -flooding devices 
and only in special case, e.g. refurbishment, by a wastewater lifting plant.

Page 201 Applicable from 5  June 2023   Figure 3.7 Diagrammatic section through a pumped system in a basement  
3.7.3  Drainage system outside a building 
A drainage system outside a dwelling, should be constructed and installed in accordance 
with the recommendations in BS EN 12056- 1: 2000, BS EN 752: 2008 and BS EN 1610: 
1998.  
Reducing the bore of a drain in the direction of flow may lead to blockages and is not 
recommended.  
Health and safety legislation requires that manual entry to a drain or sewer system is only 
undertaken where no alternative ex ists. Therefore use of remotely operated equipment will 
become the normal method of access. As well as the traditional inspection chambers used 
for depths of up to 1 m, remotely operated equipment is available for inspection, cleaning 
and removal of debris  from deeper drains and sewers, without the need for personal entry.  
3.7.4  Connection to a public  sewer  
Where a private drain discharges into a public sewer, normally at the curtilage of a 
building, some form of access should be provided for maintenance and to allow a 
satisfactory connection. The preferred method is by a disconnecting inspecting chamber 
for each house immediately inside the curtilage, although other methods and locations 
may be acceptable. Although access for maintenance purposes may be required by 
Scottish Water, design and construction of the chamber should be in accordance with the 
recommendations of BS EN 752: 2008. It is preferable that a chamber is provided for 
individual houses but where this is not practicable, a shared disconnecting chamber (or 
manhole where the depth is more than 1.2 m) should be provided in accordance with the 
requirements of Scottish Water in whom it is likely to be vested.  
The disconnecting chamber, or manhole, for a block of individually owned flats or 
maisonett es should be located as close to the building as is reasonably practicable as the 
drain will become a public sewer once it passes out with the footprint of the building.  
3.7.5  Combined  sewers  
Some sewers, called combined sewers, carry wastewater and surfac e water in the same 
pipe. These systems are not recommended today as they are more likely to surcharge 
during heavy rains. A separate drainage system carrying wastewater and surface water 
therefore should be constructed within the curtilage of a building even if it connects to a 
combined sewer to facilitate the upgrading of the combined sewer at a later date.

Page 202 Applicable from 5  June 2023   3.7.6  Conversions and  extensions  
Incorrect drainage connections, mostly related to conversions and extensions, whether 
wastewater to surface water or  vice versa, is a common occurrence and can cause severe 
pollution of watercourses or surcharging of drains also leading to pollution. A careful check 
should be made before breaking into an existing drain to ensure it is the correct one and a 
further test carried out after connection, such as a dye test, to confirm correct connection.  
3.7.7  Sewers intended for  vesting  
Where it is intended that a private sewer (a sewer connecting 2 or more buildings that are 
privately owned and maintained) will be vested in the Water Authority, construction and 
installation should be in accordance with the requirements of 'Sewers for Scotland'.  
3.7.8  Ventilation of a drainage  system  
A Wastewater drainage system serving a building should be ventilated to limit the pressure 
fluctuations within the system and minimise the possibility of foul air entering the building. 
A system should be installed in accordance with the guidance in Sections 4, 5, 6 and 
National Annex ND of BS EN 12056- 2: 2000.  
Air admittance valves are another met hod of ventilating a drainage system as they allow 
air to enter the drainage system, but not to escape, thus limiting pressure fluctuations 
within the system. Care should be taken when installing these valves that they are located 
where they will operate effectively. Air admittance valves should be installed:  
a. in accordance with the recommendations in BS EN 12380: 2002, or  
b. in compliance with the conditions of certification of a notified body.  
3.7.9  Testing  
A wastewater drainage system should be tested to ens ure the system is laid and is 
functioning correctly. Testing should be carried out in accordance with the guidance in:  
a. National Annex NG of BS EN 12056- 2: 2000, for sanitary pipework  
b. BS EN 1610: 1998, for a drainage system under and around a  building.  
3.7.10  Wastewater  discharge  
A wastewater drainage system should discharge to a public sewer or public wastewater 
treatment plant provided under the Sewerage (Scotland) Act 1968, where it is reasonably 
practicable to do so. Where it is not possibl e to discharge to a public system, for example 
in the countryside where there is no public sewer, other options are available, as described 
in the guidance to Standards 3.8 and 3.9: Private wastewater treatment  systems.

Mandatory Standard  
Standard 3.8  
Every private wastewater treatment plant or septic tank serving a building must 
be designed and constructed in such a way that it will ensure the safe temporary 
storage and treatment of wastewater prior to discharge.  
 
 
3.8.0  Introduction 
A wastewater treatment system is an effective, economical way of treating wastewater 
from buildings. It consists of 2 main components, a watertight underground tank into which 
raw sewage is fed and a system designed to discharge the wastewater safely to the 
environment without pollution. This is normally an infiltration field through which 
wastewater is released to the ground, but when ground conditions are not suitable, a 
discharge to a watercourse or coastal waters may be permitted. The infiltration field 
provides secondary treatment and is often critical for protecting the environment from 
pollution. Not all treatment plants treat to the same standard, for example, biological 
treatment plants treat the wast ewater to a much higher standard than septic tanks prior to 
release of the wastewater thus reducing pollution and permitting a smaller infiltration field. 
As there are many different types of treatment plants with varying degrees of efficiency, 
then the ty pe chosen should be selected for the effluent standard required to protect the 
environment.  
Although a septic tank is a basic form of treatment plant, it has been specifically mentioned 
in the guidance to clarify the recommendations.  
Package treatment plant is the term applied to a range of systems engineered to treat a 
given hydraulic and organic load using prefabricated components that can be installed with 
minimal site work.  
Guidance on the construction and installation of drains discharging into private wastewater 
treatment plants or septic tanks is covered by Standard 3.7.  
Conversions - in the case of conversions, as specified in regulation 4, the building as 
converted shall meet the requirements of this standard (regulation 12, schedule 6).  
3.8.1  Treat ment  plants  
Where it is not reasonably practicable to connect to a public sewer or a public wastewater 
treatment plant then discharge should be to a private wastewater treatment plant or septic 
tank.  
Treatment plants provide suitable conditions for the set tlement, storage and partial 
decomposition of solids that need to be removed at regular intervals. The discharge can 
however still be harmful and will require great care when discharging to ground to ensure a 
suitable level of protection of the environment  is achieved. A large number of small

Page 204 Applicable from 5  June 2023   sewage treatment works in a limited area is undesirable. The guidance to Standard 3.9 
deals with the infiltration system that should be constructed as an integral part of the 
treatment plant or septic tank.  
When sizing and selecting the wastewater treatment plant the designer should take full 
account of all population loadings, effluent treatment standard, and also where 
appropriate, any unusual pollution loads such as waste disposal units.  
Domestic use of detergents and disinfectants is not detrimental but excessive use may 
have a harmful effect on the performance of the sewage treatment works. The British 
Water  Code of Practice, Flow s and Loads - 2, provides guidance on sizing criteria and 
treatment capacity for small (maximum 1000 population equivalent) wastewater treatment 
systems.  
A private wastewater treatment plant and septic tank should be designed, constructed and 
installed in accordance with:  
c. the recommendations of BS EN 12566- 1: 2000, for a prefabricated septic tank, or  
d. the recommendations of BS 6297: 1983, or  
e. the conditions of certification by a notified body.  
3.8.2  Treatment plant  covers 
The settlement tank of a private wast ewater plant and a septic tank should have a securely 
sealed, solid cover that is capable of being opened by 1 person using standard operating 
keys.  
3.8.3  Inspection and  sampling 
A private wastewater plant and septic tank should be provided with a chamber for the 
inspection and sampling of the wastewater discharged from the tank. The owner should 
carry out inspection at regular intervals and SEPA can sample the effluent to ensure 
compliance with any discharge consent. A chamber should be provided in accordance with 
the following diagram.  
Figure 3.8 Section through inspection chamber  
3.8.4  Location of a treatment  plant  
Research has shown that there are no health issues that dictate a safe location of a 
treatment plant or septic tank relative to a dwelling. H owever damage to the foundations of 
a dwelling has been shown to occur where leakage from the tank has occurred. In the 

################# - Page 205 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 205 Applicable from 5  June 2023   unlikely event of there being leakage, it is sensible to ensure that any water bearing strata 
directs any liquid away from the dwelling.  To prevent any such damage therefore, every 
part of a private wastewater plant and septic tank should be located at least 5m from a 
dwelling.  
Every part of a private wastewater plant and septic tank should be located at least 5m from 
a boundary in order t hat an adjoining plot is not inhibited from its full development 
potential.  
3.8.5  Discharges from septic tanks and treatment plants  
Where mains drainage is not available, it may be possible to discharge treated wastewater 
to ground via an infiltration syst em, as described in clause 3.9.2, or to a water course, loch 
or coastal waters.  
SEPA will require an authorisation, under the terms of the Water Environment (Controlled 
Activities)(Scotland) Regulations 2005 to be applied for all discharges of sewage effluent 
whether to ground via an infiltration system or to a watercourse.  
3.8.6  Access for  desludging 
Wastewater treatment plants should be inspected monthly to check they are working 
correctly. The effluent in the outlet from the tank should be free flowing. The frequency of 
desludging will depend upon the capacity of the tank and the amount of waste draining to it 
from the dwelling but further advice on desludging frequencies should be obtained from 
the tank manufacturer or the desludging contractor.  
A privat e wastewater treatment plant and septic tank should be provided with an access 
for desludging. The desludging tanker should be provided with access to a working area 
that: 
* will provide a clear route for the suction hose from the tanker to the tank, and  
* is not more than 25 m from the tank where it is not more than 4 m higher than the 
invert level of the tank, and  
* is sufficient to support a vehicle axle load of 14 tonnes.  
3.8.7  Labelling 
Every dwelling with a drainage system discharging to a private wastewater treatment plant 
or septic tank should be provided with a label to alert the occupiers to such an 
arrangement. The label should describe the recommended maintenance necessary for the 
system and should include the following:  
'The drainage system f rom this property discharges to a wastewater treatment plant 
(or septic tank, as appropriate). The owner is legally responsible for routine 
maintenance and to ensure that the system complies with any discharge consent 
issued by SEPA and that it does not pr esent a health hazard or a nuisance'.  
The label should be located adjacent to the gas or electricity consumer unit or the water 
stopcock.

Page 206 Applicable from 5  June 2023   3.9 Private wastewater treatment systems -  
infiltration systems  
Mandatory Standard  
Standard 3.9  
Every private wastewater treatment system serving a building must be designed 
and constructed in such a way that the disposal of the wastewater to ground is 
safe and is not a threat to the health of the people in or around the building . 
 
 
3.9.0  Introduction 
The intention of this standard is to ensure that non- mains drainage systems are designed 
and constructed to a standard so that the discharges from them do not contribute to 
environmental pollution and will achieve statutory environmental standards. Subject to 
discharge authorisation from SEPA, (see clause 3.8.5) wastewater from treatment systems 
can either discharge to land via an infiltration system or to watercourses, lochs or coastal 
waters. The guidance to this standard deals with discharges to land via inf iltration systems.  
The infiltration method will form a critical part of the treatment system and care must be 
taken in the type, design and location chosen to avoid environmental pollution. The 
guidance to this standard should be used in conjunction with t he guidance to Standard 3.8 
when designing wastewater treatment systems.  
Several hundreds of wastewater treatment systems are thought to cause pollution 
problems every year. These problems occur mainly because of poor location, poor 
drainage field design o r lack of maintenance.  
Conversions - in the case of conversions, as specified in regulation 4, the building as 
converted shall meet the requirements of this standard (regulation 12, schedule 6).  
3.9.1  Assessing the suitability of the  ground 
An infiltration  system serving a private wastewater treatment plant, septic tank or for 
greywater should be constructed in ground suitable for the treatment and dispersion of the 
wastewater discharged. This can be achieved by following the guidance below.  
A ground assess ment and soil percolation test should be carried out to determine the 
suitability of the ground. The following three step procedure should be followed:  
First, carry out a preliminary ground assessment. The following check list indicates the 
actions that sh ould be taken and the type of information that should be collected:  
* consult SEPA, verifier and the Environmental Health Officer as required 
* consult SEPAs latest groundwater protection policy  
* identification of the underlying geology and aquifers  
* whether the  ground is liable to flooding  
################# - Page 207 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 207 Applicable from 5  June 2023   * nature of the sub- soil and groundwater vulnerability  
* implication of plot size  
* proximity of underground services  
* ground topography and local drainage patterns  
* whether water is abstracted for drinking, used in food processing or farm dairies  
* implication for, and of, trees and other vegetation  
* location of surface waters and terrestrial  ecosystems.  
 
The preliminary assessment may indicate that the ground is unsuitable for the installation 
of an infiltration system, in which case an alternative disposal method should be 
considered.  
Second, a trial hole should be dug to determine the position of the water table and soil 
conditions. This trial hole will enable the sub- soil type to be determined. The trial hole 
should be a minimum of 2 m deep, or a minimum of 1.5 m below the invert of the proposed 
distribution pipes. The trial hole should be left covered for a period of 48 hours before 
measuring any water table level. Subsoils that overlay bedrock allow water to move 
through the pore spaces between the grains of material of which they are composed.  
They are the first line of defence against pollution and act as a protecting filtering layer. 
Where these materials are unsaturated, pollution attenuation processes are often 
enhanced. Water flows through much of Scotland's bedrock via fissures. Attenuation of 
contaminants is limited in these cases. For safe and effective dispersal of the wastewater, 
the groundwater and bedrock should be at least 1 m below the bottom of the distribution 
pipes. It should also be noted that it is the seasonally highest level of the water table that 
should be determined for the infiltration area.  
Third, to determine the type of infiltration system and the area of ground required, 
percolation tests shoul d be carried out. These percolation tests should be carried out using 
either of the following methods:  
a. expert examination of the soil distribution analysis, using the method described in BS 
1377: Part 2: 1990, or  
b. expert in- situ testing using either the Constant Head or Tube Permeameter as 
described in CEN/TR 12566- 2-2005, or  
c. excavate a minimum of two percolation holes, not less than 5 m apart along the line of 
and below the proposed invert level of the effluent distribution pipe. Each hole should 
be 300 mm square to a depth of 300 mm. Where deep drains are necessary, the holes 
should conform to this shape at the bottom but may be enlarged above the 300 mm 
level to facilitate safe excavation. Fill the 300 mm square section of the holes to a 
depth of at least 300 mm with water and allow them to seep away overnight. It is 
important to saturate the soil surrounding the test holes to simulate day to day 
conditions in an operational drainage field. Next day, refill the test sections of the 
percolation holes with water to a depth of at least 300 mm and observe the time (t) in 
seconds, for the water to seep away from 75% to 25% full level. Divide this time by 
150 mm. The answer gives the average time in seconds (Vp) required for the water to 
drop 1 mm. Take care when making the tests to avoid unusual weather conditions 
################# - Page 208 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 208 Applicable from 5  June 2023   such as heavy rain, severe frost or drought. To obtain consistent results carry out the 
test at least 3 times for each percolation hole and take the average figure.  
The floor area of a sub -surface drainage trench required to disperse effluent from 
treatment plants or septic tanks may be calculated from the following formula:  
A= P x Vp x 0.25  
A - is the area of the sub- surface drainage trench, in m2 p - is the number of persons 
served by the tank, and 
Vp - is the percolation value obtained, as described above, in secs/mm.  
For wastewater that has received the benefit of secondary treatment followed by 
settlement, this area may be reduced by 20%, i.e.  
A = P x Vp x 0.2  
3.9.2  Design of infiltration fields  
An in filtration system serving a private wastewater treatment plant or septic tank should be 
designed and constructed to suit the conditions as determined by the ground into which 
the treated wastewater is discharged. An infiltration system should be designed a nd 
constructed in accordance with the following  guidance:  
Fast percolation rates -  where the percolation value (as demonstrated by the percolation 
test) is not more than 15 secs/mm, in accordance with the requirements of SEPA  
Normal percolation rates -  where the percolation value (as demonstrated by the 
percolation test) is more than 15 secs/mm and not more than 100 secs/mm as:  
a. a piped infiltration trench system in accordance with national annex NA of BS EN 752: 
2008, using perforated, rigid pipes with a smooth internal surface, or  
b. a piped infiltration bed system in accordance with the diagram below, or  
c. any system described under  'slow and very slow percolation rates'.  
Figure 3.9 Piped infiltration bed system  
 
 
Slow percolation rates -  where the percolation value (as demonstrated by the percolation 
test) is more than 100 secs/mm and not more than 140 secs/mm as:

b. a constructed wetland, other than a reed bed, to a professionally prepared design and 
constructed by specialist contractor(s),  or 
c. a proprietary filtration system designed, constructed and installed in accordance with 
the conditions of a notified body,  or 
d. any other equivalent f iltration system designed by a specialist in this subject and 
constructed by specialist  contractor(s).

b. for domestic sized buildings, by designing and constructing a mound filter system in 
accordance with BR 478, 'Mound Filter Systems for the treatment of domestic 
wastewater'.  
3.9.3  Greywater  disposal  
The disposal of greywater (from baths, showers, washbasins, sinks and washing 
machines) may be accomplished by an infiltration field the area of which can be calculated 
from the following:  
A= P x Vp x 0.2  
A - is the area of the sub- surface drainage trench, in m2 p - is the number of persons 
served, and  
Vp - is the percolation value obtained, as described above, in secs /mm.  
3.9.4  Location of infiltration fields - pollution 

################# - Page 210 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 210 Applicable from 5  June 2023   An infiltration system serving a private wastewater treatment plant or septic tank should be 
located to minimise the risk of pollution. An infiltration field should be located in 
accordance with the following guidance:  
a. at least 50  m from any spring, well or borehole used as a drinking water supply, and  
b. at least 10 m horizontally from any watercourse (including any inland or coastal 
waters), permeable drain, road or railway . 
3.9.5  Location of infiltration fields -  damage to buildings  
Research has shown that there are no health issues that dictate a safe location of an 
infiltration field relative to a building. However damage to the foundations of a building is 
likely to occur where discharge is too close to the building. It i s sensible to ensure that any 
water bearing strata directs any effluent away from the building.  
To prevent any such damage therefore, every part of an infiltration system serving a 
private wastewater treatment plant or septic tank should be located at leas t 5m from a 
building. An infiltration system should also be located at least 5m from a boundary in order 
that an adjoining plot is not inhibited from its full development potential.  
However the ground strata or permeability of the soil may influence this dimension and it 
may be reduced slightly where the strata directs any groundwater away from the  
foundations or if the soil is free draining. Indeed, to preserve the structural integrity of the 
building, it may be prudent to increase the dimension where ground conditions would allow 
wastewater to collect around the building's foundations.

Mandatory Standard  
Standard 3.10  
Every building must be designed and constructed in such a way that there will 
not be a threat to the building or the he alth of the occupants as a result of 
moisture from precipitation penetrating to the inner face of the building.  
Limitation:  
This standard does not apply to a building where penetration of moisture from 
the outside will result in effects no more harmful tha n those likely to arise from 
use of the building.  
 
 
3.10.0  Introduction 
Rain penetration shows up as damp patches, usually after heavy rain, on the inside of 
external walls, around door or window openings or on ceilings. It can be difficult to pinpoint 
the exact route the rainwater is taking. For example, a damp patch on a ceiling could be 
the result of a faulty flashing or damaged felt on a flat roof some distance away from the 
damp patch.  
Similarly, unless they have adequate damp proof courses and flashings, materials in 
parapets and chimneys can collect rainwater and deliver it to other parts of the dwelling 
below roof level. Penetration occurs most often through walls exposed to the prevailing wet 
winds, usually south- westerly or southerly. There is evid ence that the amount of rainfall 
has increased across much of Scotland. In addition, the majority of research indicates that 
this trend may continue as a consequence of climate change.  
There are numerous publications providing good practice guidance on met hods of 
preventing rain penetration to internal surfaces of buildings. BRE book 'Roofs and Roofing 
- performance, diagnosis, maintenance, repair and the avoidance of defects' provides 
helpful guidance for building professionals to address these problematic  issues.  
Explanation of terms - the following terms are included to provide clarity to their meaning 
in the guidance to this standard.  
A vented cavity means a cavity with openings to the outside air placed so as to allow 
some limited, but not necessarily through air movement. The openings are normally 
located at low level where they can also act as weep holes to drain water from the cavity.  
A ventilated cavity means a cavity with openings to the outside air placed so as to 
promote through movem ent of air. The openings should be located at high and low level.  
Conversions - in the case of conversions, as specified in regulation 4, the building as 
converted shall meet the requirements of this standard in so far as is reasonably 
practicable, and in no case be worse than before the conversion regulation 12, schedule 
6).

Page 212 Applicable from 5  June 2023   3.10.1  General  provisions  
A floor, wall, roof or other building element exposed to precipitation, or wind driven 
moisture, should prevent penetration of moisture to the inner surface of any part of a 
dwelling so as to protect the occupants and to ensure that the building is not damaged.  
For external wall constructions it is important that the wall is designed and constructed to 
suit the degree of exposure to wind and rain that it may be  subject to.  
BS EN ISO 15927 -3: 2009 and BS 8104: 1992 provide a range of methodologies for the 
assessment of wind driven rain on the walls of a building:  
* BS EN ISO 15927 -3: 2009 -  This methodology, which is based closely on BS 8104, 
uses two procedures to analyse hourly wind and rain data, collected for any location 
over a minimum 10 year period, to calculate a driving rain index.  
* BS 8104: 1992 - This methodology determines the degree of exposure of a wall by 
using historical wind and rain data mapped at s pecific locations across the country.  
An alternative simplified approach is provided within BR 262 'Thermal Insulation: Avoiding 
the risks'. This document is based on BS 8104 and provides a map that indicates 
exposures zones.  
Some types of buildings, such as carports or storage of outdoor equipment, can be 
unaffected by damp penetration and the following guidance therefore may not be relevant.  
When using any of the constructions below, the following general recommendations 
should be followed for walls or roofs, as appropriate:  
* masonry walls of bricks and/or blocks incorporating damp- proof courses, flashings and 
other materials and components constructed in accordance with the relevant 
recommendations of BS 5628: Part 3: 2005. The construction used should sui t the 
degree of exposure to wind and rain as described in BS EN ISO 15927- 3: 2009 or BS 
8104: 1992  
* masonry walls incorporating external rendering which conforms to the relevant 
recommendations of BS 5262: 1991, to suit the degree of exposure and the type o f 
masonry  
* masonry walls of natural stone or cast stone blocks constructed in accordance with the 
relevant recommendations of BS 5628: Part 3: 2005 and to suit the degree of exposure 
to wind and rain as described in BS EN ISO 15927- 3: 2009 or BS 8104: 1992  
* masonry cavity walls incorporating insulation material, either as a complete or partial 
cavity fill, where the insulating material is the subject of a current certificate issued 
under the relevant conditions of an independent testing body. The walls should be 
constructed in accordance with the terms of the certificate and to suit the degree of 
exposure to wind and rain as described in BS EN ISO 15927- 3: 2009 or BS 8104: 
1992; and the relevant recommendations of the following British Standards:

Page 215 Applicable from 5  June 2023   3.10.4 Extensions  
Careful consideration should be given to the detailing of an existing wall of a building when 
an extension is added. The outer leaf of a previously external wall will become an internal 
wall and any moisture that enters the cavity could collect and cause  serious damage to the 
building. Where the building is located in an exposed location or where the existing 
constr uction might allow the passage of rain either through facing brick or a poorly 
rendered masonry wall, the use of a cavity tray along the line of the roof of the extension 
may be appropriate. However in sheltered situations or where the detailing can preven t 
damage to the building as a result of rain penetration a raggled flashing (chased into the 
wall) may be sufficient.

 Figure 3.18 Wall constructions - Type C  
 
3.10. 5 Ventilation of wall  cavities 
Ventilation of external wall cavities is necessary to prevent the build -up of excessive 
moisture that could damage the fabric of a building. Ventilation holes can also be used to 
drain excess water from the cavity that has entered through the outer leaf.  
Timber frame -  interstitial condensation is one of the major problems that need to be 
addressed in timber framed buildings. To reduce the amount of interstitial condensation to 
a level that will not harm the timber frame or sheathing, a cavity of at least 50 mm wide 
shoul d be provided between the sheathing and the cladding. Where timber, slate or tile 
cladding is used, the width of the cavity should be measured between the sheathing and 
the inner face of the cladding, ignoring the battens and counter battens.  
Where the out er leaf is of timber, slate or tile clad construction, a vented cavity should be 
provided. A ventilated cavity should be provided for extra protection in severely exposed 
areas. Where necessary refer to BS 8104: 1992. Due to the air gaps inherent between t he 
components of a timber, slate or tile clad wall, no proprietary ventilators should be 
necessary and a 10 mm free air space should be sufficient.  
Cavity barriers -  where the wall cavity is sub -divided into sections by the use of cavity 
barriers e.g. at m id-floor level in a 2 storey house, the ventilators should be provided to the 
top and bottom of each section of the cavity. Care should be taken with rendered walls to 
prevent blockage of the ventilators.  
Masonry outer leaf -  where the outer leaf is of mas onry construction, venting of the cavity 
is normally sufficient. Cavities should be vented to the outside air by installing ventilators 
with at least 300 mm2 free opening area at 1.2 m maximum centres. Precipitation can

Page 217 Applicable from 5  June 2023   penetrate the outer leaf of an exter nal wall and cavities are normally drained through weep 
holes. These weep holes can also provide the necessary venting.  
3.10. 6 Roof constructions  (flat)  
The following sketches provide guidance on recommended methods of construction to 
prevent rain penetrat ion to the inner surfaces of a building.  
There is evidence to suggest that condensation in cold deck flat roofs can cause problems 
and these type of roofs should be avoided. Both the warm deck and warm deck inverted 
roof constructions, where the insulation  is placed above the roof deck, are considered 
preferable. Further guidance is given to Standard 3.15 in the domestic Handbook.  
The following British Standards give recommendations on the design and construction of 
flat roofs:

Page 220 Applicable from 5  June 2023   3.11  Facilities in  dwellings  
Mandatory Standard  
 
Standard 3.11  
Every building must be designed and constructed in such a way that:  
a) the size of any apartment or kitchen will provide a level of amenity that 
ensures the welfare and convenience of all occupants and visitors, and  
b) an accessible space is provided to allow for the safe, convenient and 
sustainable drying of washing.  
Limitation:  
This standard applies only to a dwelling.  
 
 
3.11.0  Introduction 
Guidance on design of dwellings recommends that the size of individual rooms should be 
dictated by the way a room should function and the activities that are to be accommodated 
rather than by arbitrary rule of thumb areas. This design philosophy was included in a 
report by Sir Parker Morris in the 1960s and is still relevant today.  
Extending standards to address 'liveability' and the needs of occupants supports the 
Scottish Government's aim of promoting a more inclusive built environment and will better 
address the changing needs of occupants over time. Thi s approach to the design of 
dwellings ensures that Scotland's housing stock can respond to the needs of our 
population, now and in the future.  
The provision, on one level, of an enhanced apartment, and kitchen under this standard, 
together with accessible sanitary accommodation (Standard 3.12) and improvement to 
circulation spaces (Standard 4.2) will assist in creating more sustainable homes.  
The guidance in this standard and Standard 3.12, together with the guidance in Section 4, 
Safety relating to accessi bility, has been based around, and developed from, issues that 
are included in 'Housing for Varying Needs' and the Lifetime Homes concept developed by 
the Joseph Rowntree Foundation.  
Drying of washing -  from 1963 to 1986 the building regulations included a requirement for 
the provision of drying facilities. This was removed in response to increased ownership of 
specialised appliances and the vandalism of common drying areas in blocks of flats.  
The re- introduction of space to allow washing to be dried other than by a tumble drier is 
intended to encourage the use of more sustainable methods and thereby reduce carbon 
dioxide emissions.  
Recycling - designers should be aware of local authority initiatives on the recycling of 
solid waste and useful cross -references are provided in the guidance to Standard 3.25, 
Solid waste storage. Such initiatives may affect storage provision in a dwelling.

Page 221 Applicable from 5  June 2023   Conversions - in the case of conversions, as specified in regulation 4, the buildings as 
converted shall meet the requirement  of this standard (regulation 12, schedule 6).  
3.11.1  Apartments  
Every apartment should be of a size that will accommodate at least a bed, a wardrobe and 
a chest of drawers, this being the minimum furniture provision that may be expected in 
such a room. As sociated activity spaces for each item of furniture should be shown as in 
the diagram below. A door swing may open across an activity space.  
Figure 3.29 Activity Spaces  
Additional information:  
4. Activity spaces for furniture may overlap.  
5. A built -in wardrobe space of equal size may be provided as an option to a 
wardrobe . 
3.11.2  Enhanced  apartment  
Smaller apartments or those with an unusual shape may limit how space within can be 
used. Where all apartments within a dwelling are designed in this way, this will present 
problems for occupants, particularly if affecting the main living spaces.  
Therefore, at least one apartment on the principal living level of a dwelling should be of a 
size and form that allows greater flexibility of use. This enhanced apartment should:  
* have a floor area of at least 12 m2 and a length and width at least 3.0 m (see Note 1).  
This area should exclude any space less than 1.8 m in height and any portion of the 
room designated as a kitchen, and  
* contain a unobstructed manoeuvr ing space of at least a 1.5 m by 1.5 m square or an 
ellipse of at least 1.4 m by 1.8 m, which may overlap with activity spaces 
recommended in clause 3.11.1. A door may open over this space, and  
* have unobstructed access, at least 800 mm wide, to the control s of any openable 
window or any heating appliance and between doors within the apartment.  
 

################# - Page 222 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 222 Applicable from 5  June 2023   Note 1: In some small dwellings (i.e. those with not more than 3 apartments) it may not 
always be reasonably practicable to achieve the minimum length or width of 3 m. In such 
one or two bedroom properties, either the length or the width may be reduced to not less 
than 2.8 m, however, a floor area of at least 12 m2 should be maintained.  
3.11.3  Kitchens  
A dwelling should have a kitchen and, to be accessible, this should be on the principal 
living level. Space should be provided within the kitchen to both assist in use by a person 
with mobility impairment and offer flexibility in future alteration.  
The layout should include an unobstructed manoeuvring space of at least a 1.5 m by 1.5 m 
square or an ellipse of 1.4 m by 1.8 m. A door may open across this manoeuvring space 
but a clear space of at least 1.1 m long by 800 mm wide, oriented in the direction of entry 
into the room, should remain unobstructed, to allow an oc cupant to enter and close the 
door.  
A wall- supported worktop or similar obstruction, the underside of which is at least 750 mm 
above floor level, may overlap the manoeuvring space by not more than 300 mm.  
Figure 3.30 Space provision within a kitchen  
 
Wher e a kitchen is within the same room as an apartment, the area of the kitchen should 
be defined by a rectangle enclosing any floor -standing units, appliances and worktops. In 
such cases, manoeuvring space for the kitchen may project into the apartment but s hould 
not overlap with the separate manoeuvring space of an enhanced apartment.  
A kitchen should be provided with space for a gas, electric or oil cooker or with a solid fuel 
cooker designed for continuous burning. The space should accommodate such piping,  
cables or other apparatus as will allow the appliance to operate. A cooker should have  
an activity space to allow access to, and safe use of, an oven, as shown in the diagram 
above. An activity space need not be provided in front of a hob or microwave oven.  
Kitchen storage of at least 1 m3 should be provided either within or adjacent to the kitchen. 
Additional storage may be required depending on the local authority's recycling policy.

Page 223 Applicable from 5  June 2023   3.11.4  Height of activity  spaces  
Reduced headroom, such as beneath a s loping ceiling, can cause problems in use of both 
facilities and furniture, particularly if a person has difficulty in bending or has a visual 
impairment.  
Activity spaces within the enhanced apartment or kitchen should therefore have an 
unobstructed height  of at least 1.8 m.  
3.11.5  Alterations and  extensions 
Where works to alter or extend are proposed, physical constraints in the size of an 
extension or the form of an existing building may mean that meeting recommendations in 
guidance is not always possible . Accordingly:  
* where alteration or extension of a building includes works to, or provision of a new, 
apartment on the principal living level of the dwelling, and there is not already an 
enhanced apartment on that level, guidance in clause 3.11.2 should be met as far as is 
reasonably practicable  
* where altering an existing kitchen, guidance on manoeuvring space given in clause 
3.11.3 should be met as far as is reasonably practicable.  
3.11.6  Drying of  washing 
Drying washing indoors can produce large amounts of water vapour that needs to be 
removed before it can damage the building fabric or generate mould growth that can be a 
risk to the health of occupants. The tendency to build 'tighter' buildings could increase 
these risks by trapping the moisture in the building. Providing dedicated drying areas either 
outside or inside the dwelling should discourage householders from using non- sustainable 
methods of drying washing and should encourage the adoption of alternative practices that 
limit the production  of greenhouse gases and the depletion of material resources.  
Outdoor drying space -  drying washing outside will avoid the problems of high relative 
humidity in the home and where it is reasonably practicable, an accessible space for the 
drying of washing should be provided for every house on ground immediately adjacent to, 
and in the same occupation as, the house. The area provided should allow space for at 
least 1.7 m of clothes line per apartment.  
Indoor drying space -  since weather is unreliable in Scot land, a designated space for the 
drying of washing should be provided in every dwelling, in addition to the external space.  
The designated space may be either:  
* capable of allowing a wall mounted appliance which may, for example be fixed over a 
bath, or  
* capable of allowing a ceiling- mounted pulley arrangement, or  
* a floor space in the dwelling on which to set out a clothes  horse.  
The designated space should have a volume of at least 1 m3 and should have no 
dimension less than 700 mm. The designated space should allow space for at least 1.7 m 
of clothes line per  apartment.  
################# - Page 224 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 224 Applicable from 5  June 2023   The location of the designated space should not restrict access to any other area or 
appliance within the dwelling nor obstruct the swing of any door.  
Guidance to Standard 3.14 provides infor mation on the ventilation of indoor spaces 
designated for the drying of washing.

Page 225 Applicable from 5  June 2023   3.12 Sanitary facilities  
Mandatory Standard  
Standard 3.12  
Every building must be designed and constructed in such a way that sanitary 
facilities are provided for all occupants of, and visitors to, the building in a form 
that allows convenience of use and that there is no threat to the health and 
safety of occupants or visitors.  
 
 
3.12.0  Introduction 
Sanitary accommodation that is more immediately accessible and offers both adaptability 
and flexibility of layout gives a more sustainable solution that will simplify modifications to 
the design and layout of dwellings, helping to reduce cost and disruption and better 
enabling people to remain in their home as their circumstances c hange.  
Although not recommending that sanitary facilities on the principal living level of a dwelling 
be designed to an optimum standard for wheelchair users, it should be possible for most 
people to use these facilities unassisted and in privacy.  
Extending standards to address 'liveability' and the needs of occupants supports the 
Scottish Government's aim of promoting a more inclusive built environment and will better 
address the changing needs of occupants over time. This approach to the design of 
dwellin gs ensures that Scotland's housing stock can respond to the needs of our 
population, now and in the future.  
The guidance in this standard and Standard 3.11, together with the guidance in Section 4, 
Safety relating to accessibility, has been based around, a nd developed from, issues that 
are included in 'Housing for Varying Needs' and the Lifetime Homes concept developed by 
the Joseph Rowntree Foundation.  
The provision, on one level, of accessible sanitary accommodation under this standard, 
together with an enhanced apartment, and kitchen (Standard 3.11) and improvement to 
circulation spaces (Standard 4.2) will assist in creating more sustainable homes.  
Lead in water -  the human body absorbs lead easily from drinking water and this can 
have a negative effect on the intellectual development of young children. Although mains 
water supplies do not contain significant levels of lead, recent research studies have 
shown that  leaded solder plumbing fittings, normally used for heating systems, have been 
used on drinking water pipework in contravention of the Scottish Water Byelaws 2004. 
Further guidance can be obtained from Scotland and Northern Ireland Plumbing 
Employers Federation  (SNIPEF) and Scottish Water .  
Conversions - in the case of conversions, as specified in regulation 4, the building as 
converted shall meet the requirement of this standard (regulation 12, schedule 6).  
 
################# - Page 226 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 226 Applicable from 5  June 2023   3.12.1  Sanitary provision 
Every dwelling should have sanitary facilities comprising at least 1 watercloset (WC), or 
waterless closet , together with 1 wash hand basin per WC, or waterless closet, 1 bath or 
shower and 1 sink. It is normal for the sink to be located in a kitchen.  
To allow for basic hygiene, a wash hand basin should always be close to a WC or 
waterless closet, either withi n a toilet, or located in an adjacent space providing the sole 
means of access to the toilet.  
There should be a door separating a space containing a WC, or waterless closet, from a 
room or space used for the preparation or consumption of food, such as a ki tchen or dining 
room.  
3.12.2  Waterless closets 
If a waterless closet is installed it should be to a safe and hygienic design such as:  
a. National Sanitation Foundation Certification to Standard NSF 41: 'wastewater 
recycling/ reuse and water conservation devic es', or  
b. NFS International Standard NSF/ANSI 41- 1999: 'non- liquid saturated treatment 
systems', or  
c. to the conditions of a certification by a notified  body.  
Although some European countries manufacture waterless closets, they have not as yet 
been tested to any recognised standard. This does not mean that they are unacceptable, 
just that care should be taken in their choice to ensure they are both safe and hygienic in 
use. 
3.12.3  Accessible sanitary  accommodation 
Bathrooms and toilets designed to minimum space standards can often create difficulties 
in use. As the ability of occupants can vary significantly, sanitary accommodation should 
be both immediately accessible and offer potential for simple alteration in the future.  
A dwelling should have at least 1 acc essible WC, or waterless closet, and wash hand 
basin and at least 1 accessible shower or bath.  
These sanitary facilities should be located on the principal living level of a dwelling and be 
of a size and form that allows unassisted use, in privacy, by almost any occupant. This 
should include use by a person with mobility impairment or who uses a wheelchair, albeit 
with limited manoeuvring space within the sanitary  accommodation.  
An additional accessible toilet may be needed on the entrance level of a dwelli ng where 
this is not also the principal living level (see clause 4.2.10).  
Accessible sanitary accommodation should have:  
* a manoeuvring space that will allow a person to enter and close the door behind them. 
This should be at least 1.1 m long by 800 mm wide, oriented in the direction of entry, 
and clear of any door swing or other obstruction, and  
* except where reduced by projection of a wash hand basin, unobstructed access at 
least 800 mm wide to each sanitary facility,  and 
################# - Page 227 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 227 Applicable from 5  June 2023   * an activity space for each sanitary  facility, as noted in the diagram below. These may 
overlap with each other and with the manoeuvring space noted above. A door may 
open over an activity space, and  
* an unobstructed height above each activity space and above any bath or shower of at 
least 1. 8 m above floor level, and  
* walls adjacent to any sanitary facility that are of robust construction that will permit 
secure fixing of grab rails or other aids in the zones noted in figure 3.32 (all indicated 
sizes are minimum dimensions), and  
* where incorporating a WC, space for at least one recognised form of unassisted 
transfer from a wheelchair to the WC.  
Figure 3.31 Activity spaces for accessible sanitary facilities  
 
Additional information:  
1. Though commonly as shown, the activity space in fr ont of a WC need not be parallel 
with the axis of the WC.  
2. Where allowing side transfer, a small wall -hung wash hand basin may project up to 
300 mm into the activity space in front of the WC.  
3. The projecting rim of a wash hand basin may reduce the width of a route to another 
sanitary facility to not less than 700  mm. 
4. A hand- rinse basin should only be installed within a toilet and only if there is a full -size 
wash hand basin elsewhere in the dwelling.  

################# - Page 228 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 228 Applicable from 5  June 2023   An accessible bathroom should be of a size that will accommodate a 1.7 m x 700 mm 
bath (or equivalent). The activity space in front of a bath may be at any position along its 
length. Within an accessible bathroom, it should be possible to replace the bath with an 
accessible shower without adversely affecting  access to other sanitary facilities.  
An accessible shower room should be of a size that will accommodate either a level - 
access floor shower with a drained area of not less than 1.0 m x 1.0 m (or equivalent) or a 
900 mm x 900 mm shower tray (or equivalent ). The drained area of a level -access floor 
shower may overlap with activity or manoeuvring spaces where access to other sanitary 
facilities is not across the drained area.  
Alternative - space for future shower -  where a dwelling has a bathroom or shower 
room on another level, which is not en suite to a bedroom, some occupants may not 
require the immediate provision for bathing on the principal living level. Where this is the 
case, the principal living level may instead have a separate, enclosed space of a size that, 
alone or by incorporation with the accessible toilet, will permit formation of an accessible 
shower room (as described above) at a future date. This space can, instead, offer useful 
storage space.  
This space should have a drainage connection, positioned to allow installation of either a 
floor shower or raised shower tray, sealed and terminated either immediately beneath floor 
level under a removable access panel or at floor level in a visible position. The structure 
and insulation of the floor in the area identified for a future floor shower should allow for 
the depth of an inset tray installation (all floors) and a 'laid to fall' installation (solid floors 
only). If not adjacent to an accessible toilet and separated by an easily demountable 
partition, a duct to the external air should be provided to allow for later installation of 
mechanical ventilation.  
Examples of robust wall construction include masonry walling and suitably reinforced 
timber and metal stud partitioning. The following sketches i ndicate how timber or metal 
stud partitioning may be reinforced in preparation for the future installation of grab rails.

securing plywood reinforcement to metal stud partitioning.  
3.12.4  Access to sanitary  accommodation  
Where an apartment is intended for use solely as a bedroom, it is considered a pri vate 
space. To ensure that privacy can be maintained, the only accessible sanitary 
accommodation in a dwelling should not be en suite, reached through such an apartment.  
3.12.5  Alteration and extensions  
Additional sanitary facilities need not be provided as part of an extension to, or 
alteration of, a dwelling. However an additional accessible toilet may be needed under the 
circumstances set out in clause 4.2.10, if one does not exist on the entrance level of a 
dwelling.  
If it is intended to install a new s anitary facility on the principal living level or entrance 
storey of a dwelling and there is not already an accessible sanitary facility of that type 
within the dwelling, the first new facility should be in accordance with the guidance given in 
clauses 3.12.3 and 3.12.4.  
In the case of alterations within an existing dwelling, the new sanitary facility should be in 
accordance with guidance given in clause 3.12.3 as far as is reasonably practicable. This 
recognises that it may not always be possible, within t he confines of an existing building, 
for accessible sanitary facility to be in accordance with guidance and that the provision of a 
facility that is usable by most occupants will still improve amenity.  
Alteration of existing facilities -  if altering existing sanitary accommodation on the 
principal living level or entrance storey of a dwelling which meets the guidance in clause

at least maintain the level of compliance present before alterations.  
Existing sanitary accommodation which meets the guidance in clause 3.12.3 or the 
previous guidance for an accessible toilet (see below) should only be removed or 
relocated where facilities at least equivalent to those removed wil l still be present within 
the dwelling.

altered or removed where the minimum provision for a dwelling, set out in clause 3.12.1, is 
maintained.  
Accessibility of  existing facilities -  however where activity spaces for existing sanitary 
facilities come close to meeting either the current recommendations in clause 3.12.3 or the

Mandatory Standard  
Standard 3.13  
Every building must be designed and constructed in such a way t hat it can be 
heated and maintain heat at temperature levels that will not be a threat to the 
health of the occupants.  
Limitation:  
This standard applies only to a dwelling.  
 
 
3.13.0  Introduction 
Heating in a building is necessary to provide suitable conditions in which to live. Heating, 
ventilation and thermal insulation should be considered as part of a total design that takes 
into account all heat gains and losses. Failure to do so can lead to inadequate internal 
conditions, e.g. condensati on and mould and the inefficient use of energy due to 
overheating.  
Whole house 'central heating' is now almost universal, particularly in new buildings and is 
regarded as almost essential in combating problems such as condensation and mould 
growth.  
Normal activities within a dwelling add both heat and water vapour to the air. If the heating 
maintains comfort levels in the whole at all times, condensation problems will be 
minimised, but costs will be high. A reasonable compromise needs to be given to heating  
and ventilation to reduce the possibility of such problems and guidance is provided for both 
these issues in this sub -section. Section 6, Energy, provides guidance on the third issue, 
thermal insulation.  
This guidance covers dwellings only as the heating of buildings other than dwellings is 
covered by the Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations.  
Conversions - in the case of conversions, as specified in regulation 4, the building as 
converted shall meet the requirement of this standard (regulation 12, schedule 6).  
3.13.1  Heating  recommendations  
The layout of a dwelling, the size and orientation of the windows, the thermal mass, level 
of insulation, airtightness, and ventilation can have a significant affect on the demand for 
heat. The performance of a heating system will also have a major affect on energy 
efficiency. Section 6, Energy provides guidance on these issues.  
Heating a dwelling will normally be tailored to personal comfort taking cost into 
consideration. However  in addition to comfort, the heating should reflect the combined 
effects of occupancy pattern, ventilation provision, building mass and insulation to reduce 
the possibility of producing excess condensation that might damage the building fabric.  
################# - Page 233 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 233 Applicable from 5  June 2023   Every dwell ing should have some form of fixed heating system, or alternative that is 
capable of maintaining a temperature of 21 oC in at least 1 apartment and 18 oC 
elsewhere, when the outside temperature is minus 1 oC.  
There is no need to maintain these temperatures  in storage rooms with a floor area of not 
more than 4 m2. 
3.13.2  Alternative heating  systems  
Alternative heating systems may involve a holistic design approach to the dwelling and can 
include the use of natural sources of available energy such as the sun,  wind and the 
geothermal capacity of the earth. Passive design, such as use of the orientation of glazing 
for solar gain and of the building mass to store heat with controlled heat release may only 
need minor supplementation from a lower output fixed heati ng system. Active heating 
systems, such as heat pumps that extract heat from ground, air, water or geo- thermal 
sources, can limit emissions of carbon dioxide and reduce the use of fossil fuels. 
Complementary systems can also be used, to heat water using solar energy or generate 
electricity using solar or wind power.  
Where there are elderly or infirm occupants in a dwelling the capability of the heating 
system to maintain an apartment at a temperature higher than 21 oC is a sensible 
precaution. Since it is not possible to determine the occupants at design stage the heating 
system should be designed with the capability of being easily upgraded at a later date.  
If an existing heating system is to be upgraded to provide higher temperatures the boiler 
size may no t need to be replaced, provided it was correctly sized originally. The upgrading 
may necessitate the replacement of some pipes and radiator in one or two rooms and 
accessibility will need to be considered. Such modification could result in a small increase 
in the recovery time of the hot water supply for bathing and washing.

Page 234 Applicable from 5  June 2023   3.14 Ventilation  
Mandatory Standard  
Standard 3.14  
Every building must be designed and constructed in such a way that ventilation 
is provided so that the air quality inside the building is not a threat to the 
building or the health of the occupants.  
 
 
3.14.0  Introduction 
Ventilation of a dwelling is required to maintain air quality and so contribute to the health 
and comfort of the occupants. Without ventilation it is possible that carbon dioxide, water 
vapour, organic impurities, smoking, fumes and gases could reduce the air quality by 
humidity, dust and odours and also reduce the percentage of oxygen in the air to make the 
building less comfortable to work or live in.  So that contaminan ts do not exceed  acceptable 
levels  and thereby  endanger  the health of the occupants,  it is important  that dwellings  are 
adequately  ventilated.  Research has shown that occupants of dwellings are, for the most 
part, unaware of the standard of air quality within their homes. The lack of recognition of 
poor air quality has frequently resulted in occupants not being aware of the need to open 
ventilators or windows, particularly in bedrooms.  
Well- designed  ventilation has many  benefits, not least  financial  and environmental,  although it 
is also recognised that inside air quality  can only be as good  as outside  air quality  and in 
some cases filtration may be necessary. It is becoming more common, due in the main to 
improved  insulation standards  and reduced levels  of fabric  infiltration,  to specify continuous 
mechanical  systems to provide the ventilation solution  for the building.  
Ventilation can also have a significant effect on energy consumption and performance and 
so thorough assessment  of provisions  for both ventilation  and energy  performance,  should be 
made,  as uninformed choices  may significantly  affect both indoor  air quality  or the energy 
efficiency  of the building  (see Section  6, Energy).  
Ventilation should not adversely affect comfort and, where necessary, designers might wish 
to consider security issues and protection against rain penetration prevalent in naturally 
ventilated buildings when windows are partially open to provide background ventilation.  
The impact of reducing air infiltration - improved insulation and 'tighter' construction of 
buildings  will reduce the infiltration  and the level of natural  air change.  
Unless ventilation is maintained, this can increase the risk of poorer indoor air quality and 
issues such as condensation and mould growth. Conversely, leaky buildings can be 
draughty  and uncomfortable.  Sealing  up air leaks  improves  comfort and saves  energy  whilst 
proper  ventilation keeps  the indoor  air pleasant  and healthy.  If poor attention  to detail  occurs 
air leakage can account  for a substantial  part of the heating  costs.  Energy  savings from 
building 'tighter' could make significant savings on energy bills. There is a common 
perception that 'tight' construction promotes indoor air pollution. However both 'tight' and 
'leaky'  buildings  can have air quality  problems.  Though air leaks  can dilute  indoor  pollutants, 
there is no control  over how much  leakage occurs,  when it occurs or where it comes  from.  
################# - Page 235 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 235 Applicable from 5  June 2023   Occupants  should have the opportunity  to dry washing other  than by a tumble dryer  which 
uses a considerable amount of energy. Drying of washing internally can generate large 
quantities  of moisture that should be removed at source  to limit any adverse impact  on the 
building or its occupants.  
In addition to the clauses below, further guidance on aspects of ventilation installations, 
including controls,  installation  and commissioning  of systems is provided with Annex  3.A - 
'Domestic Ventilation  Guide'.  
Conversions - in the case of conversions, as specified in regulation 4,  
the building  as converted shall meet  the requirement  of this standard  (regulation 12, schedule  
6). 
3.14.1  Ventilation  generally 
Ventilation is the process  of supplying outdoor  air to an enclosed  space  and removing stale air  
from the space.  It can manage  the indoor  air quality  by both diluting  the indoor  air with less  
contaminated  outdoor  air and removing  the indoor  contaminants  with the exhaust  air. 
Ventilation should  have the capacity  to: 
* provide outside air to maintain  indoor  air quality  sufficient  for human  respiration 
* remove excess  water  vapour  from areas  where it is produced in sufficient  quantities  in 
order  to reduce the likelihood of creating conditions  that support  the germination and 
growth of mould,  harmful  bacteria,  pathogens  and allergies  
* remove pollutants  that are a hazard to health from areas  where they are produced in 
significant  quantities  
* rapidly  dilute  pollutant  odours,  where  necessary.  
Ventilation should  be to the outside  air. However,  clauses  3.14.4.  3.14.5 and 3.14.11  explain 
where ventilators  and background ventilators  may be installed  other  than to the external  air. 
Additional ventilation provision  
This guidance relates  to the provision of air for human  respiration and is in addition to, and 
should  be kept separate  from,  any air supply  needed for the smoke  ventilation  of escape 
routes in the case of fire (Section 2, Fire) and for the safe operation of combustion 
appliances (see Standards 3.21 and 3.22). Provision of ventilation will also assist in 
removing heat from a building in the summer months, reducing the risk of summertime 
overheating (see standard 3.28).  
Small rooms  
There is no need to ventilate a room with a floor area of not more than 4 m2. This is not 
intended to include a domestic  sized  kitchen  or utility  room  where ventilation  should be in 
accordance with the recommendations  in clause  3.14.2.  
Calculation of volume  
For ventilation purposes,  a storey  should be taken  as the total floor area of all floors  within that  
storey,  including the floor area of any gallery  or openwork  floor.  Where an air change rate is 
recommended, the volume of the space to be ventilated may be required. The volume of any 
space  is the internal  cubic  capacity  of the space.  Any volume  more  than 3 metres  above  any 
floor level in that space may be disregarded.

Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 236 Applicable from 5  June 2023   3.14.2  Ventilation  of dwellings  
All buildings  leak air to a greater  or lesser  extent. However  the movement  of uncontrolled 
infiltrating  air through the fabric  of a building  can cause  draughts  and can have a significant 
adverse effect on the energy  efficiency  of the building as a whole.  By improving  building  
techniques  it is possible to reduce  this infiltrating  air to lower  levels  which can  improve energy 
efficiency  (see Section  6 Energy).  
Some  building techniques  may have little effect on air leakage  and so allow the uncontrolled 
infiltrating  air to be taken  into account  as part of building  ventilation  provision.  
By building  with techniques  designed to reduce air leakage there will need to be a reciprocal  
increase in the designed ventilation provision to make up for the lower levels of infiltrating 
air. 
Ventilation  is delivered via three  components  - supply  air, extraction  and purge ventilation. 
Under normal conditions, indoor air quality is provided for by the supply and extraction 
elements. Purge ventilation is essential for removal of higher levels of pollutants on an 
intermittent  or occasional  basis  and can also assist  in the cooling  of the dwelling  during the 
summer  months.  
Choice of ventilation solution 
Infiltration  (air movement  through  building  fabric)  is considered as a component  of overall 
ventilation.  Accordingly,  the provision of intended ventilation should be made to reflect  the 
level of fortuitous ventilation occurring through building fabric. Guidance to this standard sets 
out three forms of supply  and extract  ventilation:  
1. Natural  ventilation  (with  intermittent  mechanical  extract)  - see clause 3.14.4.  
2. Continuous  mechanical  extract  - see clause  3.14.5.  
3. Continuous  mechanical  supply  and extract  clause  - see clause 3.14.6.  
Provisions  are recommended on the basis  of the design  and confirmed  infiltration  rate for the 
dwelling as  follows:  
Table 3.5a -  Ventilation solutions for design infiltration levels.  
Ventilation type  Suitable for infiltration rate:  
Natural ventilation (with intermittent mechanical extract)  >= 5 m3/(h.m2)@50Pa  
Continuous mechanical extract ventilation  >= 3 m3/(h.m2)@50Pa  
Continuous mechanical supply & extract ventilation Any 
Designer  may choose to provide evidence  of the suitability  of another  option  for any of the 
above  categories.  
Supply air  
Supply air for the dwelling should be delivered through either background ventilators 
(options 1 & 2 above) or continuous supply fans (option 3 above). The minimum whole 
dwelling  ventilation  rate for the supply  of air to the habitable rooms  in a dwelling  should meet 
both of the criteria  given  in table  3.5b below  for ventilation,  by number  of apartments  and by 
overall dwelling floor area.  
 
 
################# - Page 237 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 237 Applicable from 5  June 2023   Table 3.5b -  Minimum whole dwelling ventilation rate  
 
Number of apartments  11 2 3 4 5 
Minimum ventilation rate -  
litres/second 2 13 19 25 31 37 
Minimum ventilation rate -  by floor area 3: 0.3 l/s per m2 of internal floor area 
Notes:  
1. Where the dwelling  has only one habitable room  (principal  apartment),  a minimum 
ventilation  rate of 13 litres per  second is assigned.  
2. For each additional  apartment,  add 6 litres  per second to the values above.  
3. The minimum ventilation  rate 0.3 litres  per second per m2 of internal  floor area.  (This 
includes  all floors,  e.g. for a two-storey  building  add the ground and first floor areas).  
Background ventilator area  
For the purpose of performance,  the recommended areas  for background ventilation  (see 
clauses  3.14.4  & 3.14.5)  should be achieved by the use of ventilators  that are sized  by the 
equivalent area, as determined using BS EN 13141 -1:2019. When determining the 
equivalent area, the whole ventilator installation, including the external grille or canopy, 
should  be considered as a single unit. Background ventilators  should have the equivalent area 
marked where it will be easily visible from inside the dwelling when installed, to aid 
verification  
Air flow within the dwelling  
To enable effective air movement throughout the dwelling, ventilation should be provided 
between rooms and circulation spaces. This is commonly achieved at each internal door 
serving a ventilated space, providing a minimum free area equivalent to a 10 mm gap 
beneath each  door (minimum  door widths  are set out in clause  4.2.6).  The underside  of the 
door leaf should be either:  
* If the floor finish  is fitted, 10 mm above  the floor finish  
* If the finish  is not fitted,  20 mm above  the floor surface.  
Where  the door is a fire door,  this should not involve  trimming  of the door leaf, but instead 
raising the leaf within the door set to provide the recommended gap. Alternatively, 
equivalent  ventilation  provision can be made  through  the wall dividing  each  space.  
Open- flued appliances  
Care  should be taken when installing  mechanical  extract  systems  where there  is an open-  
flued combustion appliance in the dwelling.  Further  guidance is provided in clause 3.17.8.  
3.14.3  Provision for purge  ventilation 
Provision of purge ventilation enables occupants to remove higher concentrations of 
pollutants  or water  vapour  from occasional  activities  that give rise to such  increases.  It can 
also assist  in the cooling  of a dwelling  in the summer  months.  
A system for purge ventilation is required in each habitable room (apartment). The 
recommended ventilator opening areas in Table 3.6 below are set to give reasonable 
################# - Page 238 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 238 Applicable from 5  June 2023   assurance that purge ventilation is capable of providing  air change  of at least  of four air 
changes  per hour per room  directly  to outside.  
Purge  ventilation can be delivered  through  either  openings  (e.g. windows  or doors)  or by a 
mechanical  extract  system  with a suitable  high extract  rate. The latter  may be more  common if 
there are environmental  issues such  as noise  or pollution  which  make it more  desirable  to 
provide occasional  higher  levels  of ventilation  via a mechanical  extract  system.  
Where  purge ventilation in a habitable room  is delivered  through  openings  in that room,  the 
minimum opening areas in Table 3.6 should be achieved. These are based on BS 
5925:1991,  and assumes  all of the following:  
* single -sided ventilation  
* an urban environment  
* a wind speed of 2.1 metres  per second  
* a temperature difference of 3 degC between  the air inside  and outside of the building.  
Depending on the dwelling design or the external climate, it may be possible in other 
circumstances  to achieve  4 air changes  per hour with smaller  openings.  If smaller  openings 
than Table 3.6 are specified, this should be supported by evidence from an appropriately 
qualified  person competent  in such  matters.  
Table 3.6 -  Purge ventilation openings to apartments  
 
Opening type  Minimum total area of openings  
Hinged or pivot windows with an opening 
angle of 15 to 30 degrees.  1/10 of floor area of room  
External doors; Opening sash windows; 
Hinged or pivot windows with an opening 
angle of greater than 30 degrees.  1/20 of floor area of room  
Note: hinged or pivot windows with an opening angle of less than 15 degrees are not 
suitable  for purge ventilation.  Reference to opening  angles  relates  to the presence  of a 
permanent  restriction  to a greater  opening  angle. To reduce the effects of stratification of the 
air in a room, some part of the window(s) should be at least 1.75 m above floor level.  
3.14.4  Natural  ventilation  (with  intermittent  mechanical  extract)  
It is recommended that natural ventilation with intermittent extract only be considered in 
dwellings  where low or very low fabric  infiltration  is not present  or planned.  This would  be 
where the infiltration  rate is 5 m3/(h.m2)@50  Pa and above.  
Note  also that, for dwellings  with a single  aspect  or an internal  kitchen,  the guidance below 
may not suffice  to provide sufficient  ventilation and further  advice  should be sought  from the 
designers  or an alternate  solution proposed.  
Purge ventilation is as set out in clause 3.14.3 
Background ventilation  
Natural ventilation relies upon a combination of fortuitous ventilation and background 
ventilation  to drive air movement.  This is assisted  by the intermittent  use of mechanical 
extract  ventilation  to remove air from rooms  where  activities  will generate  water  vapour  - 
kitchens,  utility  rooms,  bathrooms  and sanitary  accommodation.

Additional information:  
1. Where  the background ventilator  is ducted,  the recommended areas  in the table should 
be doubled to account  for flow resistance  within  the ductwork.  
2. The overall provision of background ventilation in a dwelling may be provided at an 
average of 11,000  mm2 per room  with a minimum  of 11,000 mm2 for each  apartment.  
3. To reduce the effects  of stratification  of the air in a room,  some  part of the background 
ventilator  should be at least  1.75 m above  floor level.  
4. Further advice on the location of background ventilators can be found in Annex 3 A.  
Extract ventilation  
Intermittent mechanical extract fans should be fitted in each room where activities will 
generate  water  vapour  - kitchens,  utility  rooms,  spaces  for drying washing,  bathrooms  and 
sanitary  accommodation.  Extract  rates  should be as set out below.  
Table 3.7b -  Minimum extract rates for intermittent extract ventilation systems

Sanitary accommodation (Toilet) 4 6 litres per second  
Additional information:  
5. Where  a room  has both extract  fan and background ventilators,  these should be a 
minimum  of 0.5 m apart  (within  and outside  the dwelling)  to reduce the risk of 'short 
circuiting' ventilation.  
6. Refer  to guidance to Standard 3.17 and OFTEC  Technical  Book  3 where  an extract  fan is 
fitted  in a building  containing an open- flued combustion  appliance.  
7. In design of a system, where exhaust air terminals are in a location exposed to prevailing 
winds,  measures  should be taken  to minimise  the adverse effect of wind on the extract  
rate. This may include  relocation of extract  terminals  to another  location or the use of 
constant  volume  flow rate units.  
8. For a toilet  (WC & WHB)  provision of purge ventilation  in accordance with clause  3.14.3 is 
an alternative to intermittent mechanical  extract.  
################# - Page 240 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 240 Applicable from 5  June 2023   It is noted that passive  stack ventilation  (PSV)  can be used as an alternative to intermittent 
mechanical  extract  in wet rooms.  A passive  stack ventilation  system  should be installed  in 
accordance with the recommendations set out in BRE Information Paper BRE IP 13/94, 
noting that such  systems  are most  suited  for use in dwellings  with a height  of not more  than 4  
storeys as the stack  effect  will diminish  as the air cools.  
Work on existing buildings  
Where infiltration  rates  in a dwelling  exceed  10 m3/h/m2 @ 50 Pa, which  may often  be the 
case in existing buildings, the size of background ventilation may be reduced to 8000 mm2 
for apartments and 4000 mm2 for all other rooms. Alternatively, the overall provision of 
background  ventilation  in a dwelling  may be provided at an average of 6000 mm2 per room, 
with a minimum provision of 4000 mm2 in each apartment.  
3.14.5  Continuous  mechanical  extract  ventilation 
For new dwellings  with building  fabric  which  has low infiltration,  ventilation by a continuous 
mechanical  extract  system  (see below)  or continuous  mech anical  supply  and extract  system 
(see clause 3.14.6) is recommended. 'Low infiltration' is defined as a design intent of not 
less than 3 m3/(h.m2)@ 50Pa and less than 5 m3/(h.m2)@50 Pa, which is realised on 
construction.  
A continuous mechanical extract ventilation system should provide for ventilation of the whole  
dwelling  and may be delivered  either  by a central  extract  fan system,  by individual extract  fans 
or a combination of these  solutions.  
Purge ventilation is as set out in clause 3.14.3 
Background ventilation 
Where  continuous  mechanical  extract  ventilation  is used,  background ventilators  should 
provide a minimum  equivalent  area of 4,000  mm2 for each apartment  in the dwelling.  
Background ventilators should not be installed in a room with continuous mechanical 
extract, to avoid short circuiting of ventilation pathways. However, where a kitchen is within 
the same space as an apartment (e.g. living room/dining room), specialist design advice 
should be sought.  
Where the background ventilator  is ducted,  the recommended area above should be doubled 
to account  for flow resistance  within  the ductwork.  
To reduce the effects  of stratification  of the air in a room,  some  part of the background 
ventilator  should  be at least  1.75 m above  floor level.  
Extract  ventilation  
Continuous mechanical extract fans should be fitted in each room where activities will 
generate water vapour ('wet rooms') - kitchens, utility rooms, spaces for drying washing, 
bathrooms,  shower  rooms  and sanitary  accommodation.  Minimum  room  extract  rates  should 
be as set out below.

2. In design of a system, where exhaust air terminals are in a location exposed to 
prevailing winds,  measures  should be taken  to minimise  the adverse effect  of wind on the 
extract  rate. This may include  relocation of extract  terminals  to another  location or the use 
of constant  volume flow rate units.  
3. Extract  in a designated  drying area which  is not also another  of the rooms  described 
above may operate only on an intermittent basis, controlled by a humidistat -  see 
clause 3.14.9. In such cases, it is excluded from the whole dwelling continuous 
ventilation rate calculation.  
3.14.6  Continuous  mechanical  supply  and extract ventilation  
For new dwellings with building fabric which has very low infiltration, ventilation by a 
continuous  mechanical  supply  and extract  system  is recommended.  Such  systems can also 
be used  for any level of building infiltration.  'Very  low infiltration' is defined as a design intent of 
less than 3 m3/(h.m2)@50Pa which is realised on construction. Such systems will normally  
include heat recovery - MVHR  (mechanical  ventilation  with heat recovery).  
To avoid unintended air pathways,  background ventilators  should not be installed  with 
mechanical  supply  and extract  ventilation  systems.  
Purge ventilation is as set out in clause 3.14.3 
Supply ventilation  
Each  apartment  should  have mechanical  supply  ventilation,  with supply  terminals  located and 
directed  to avoid draughts.  The total supply  air flow should meet  the minimum  whole dwelling 
ventilation rate set out in Table 3.5b in clause 3.14.2 and be distributed proportionately  to 
the volume  of each  habitable room.  
Extract ventilation  
Each  wet room  should have mechanical  extract  ventilation  which  can provide a high/boost rate  
as set out in Table 3.8 in clause  3.14.5.  The continuous  rate of the extract  ventilation system  
should provide the minimum whole  dwelling  ventilation  rate set out in Table  3.5b in Clause  
3.14.2.

Note that specialist advice must be sought if considering installation of an open- flued 
appliance within  a dwelling  with continuous  mechanical  supply  and extract  ventilation  to 
identify  and provide assurance  on supply  of air for combustion.  
3.14.7  Ventilation  awareness  in dwellings  
Carbon  dioxide  (CO 2) is present  in the external  air we breathe at concentration  levels  of 
around 400 parts  per million  and is not harmful  to health at low concentration levels. However,  
as people release CO 2 into the air when they exhale,  increased levels  of CO 2 in occupied  
buildings  can occur.  This is generally  accepted as being a reasonable indication that 
ventilation action is  necessary.  
CO 2 monitoring equipment  
A CO 2 monitor should be provided in the apartment expected to be the main or principal 
bedroom in a dwelling. This should raise occupant awareness of CO 2 levels (and therefore 
other  pollutants)  present  in their homes  and of the need  for them  to take proactive  measures 
to increase the ventilation.  Guidance on the operation  of the monitoring equipment,  including 
options for improving ventilation when indicated as necessary by the monitor, should be 
provided to the occupant. For more detailed inform ation on the provision of guidance to 
occupants,  reference should be made to sections  3.A.9  & 3.A.10  of Annex  3A - 'Domestic 
Ventilation Guide'.  
The installed monitoring equipment for CO 2 should be mains operated and may take the 
form of a self -contained monitor/detector or a separate monitor and detector head. The 
monitor  should have an easily  understood  visual  indicator  and be capable  of logging  data to 
allow the occupant to gain information on CO 2 levels for at least the preceding 24 hour 
period. If the detector/monitor has an audible alarm this should be capable of being 
permanently  deactivated.  
CO 2 monitoring  equipment  should be capable of recording and displaying readings  within  a 
range of at least 0 -  5,000 parts per million. The equipment should also be capable of 
logging  data at no more  than 15 minute intervals,  over a 24 hour period.  
Where carbon dioxide monitors/detectors are within the scope of either or both:  
* European  Directive  2014/35/EU  - Low Voltage  Directive  (LVD),  and/or  
* European Directive  2014/53/EU  - Radio  Equipment  
they should  be constructed to fully comply  with all applicable  safety  aspects  of the Directive(s)  
as implemented through  UK regulations.  
A carbon dioxide  detector  head  requires  a flow of air over it to operate correctly,  therefore,  it 
should not be located in an area that is likely to restrict the free movement of air. Unless 
otherwise indicated by the manufacturer, a carbon dioxide detector head should not be 
sited:  
* if ceiling  mounted,  within  300 mm of any wall 
* if wall mounted,  within  150 mm of the ceiling  or a junction with another  wall 
* where  it can be obstructed (for example  by curtains,  blinds  or furniture)  
* next to a door or window,  or 
################# - Page 243 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 243 Applicable from 5  June 2023   * next to an air vent or similar  ventilation opening.  
Unless  otherwise indicated  by the manufacturer,  a carbon dioxide  monitor,  with or without an 
integral detector, should be mounted between 1.4 m and 1.6 m above floor level. A carbon 
dioxide detector  head  (or monitor  if integrated)  should not be sited  within  1 m of the expected 
location  of a bed-head.  
Where a separate detector  head  and monitor  is installed,  the monitor  may be located  other 
than in the room containing the detector head, for example, the hallway. This may be 
desirable if more  than one detector  head  is installed.  
3.14.8  Commissioning  and written  information.  
Commissioning of mechanical elements of an installed ventilation system should be 
undertaken as set out for the relevant  system  in sections  3.A.5  to 3.A.7  of Annex  3.A - 
'Domestic Ventilation  Guide'.  
Correct  use and maintenance of the ventilation  systems will assist  in delivering  the designed 
ventilation  to the dwelling  whilst  minimising  energy  use and environmental  problems  such as 
noise and thermal  discomfort.  To assist  in this, the following  information should be provided 
and made  available  to the occupant(s)  of the dwelling,  as relevant  to the installed  system.  
* a design statement  that sets out the key characteristics of the system  along  with non- 
technical  information  on how and when the system  should be used;  
* manufacturer's contact  details;  
* instructions  on how to use background ventilators  for background ventilation;  
* location  of, and setting  of, automatic  controls  (e.g. humidity  and timer  controls);  
* location  and use of on/off  and boost  settings  for mechanical  ventilation  systems;  
* Instructions  on how and when cleaning and maintenance  should be carried  out, including 
air filter  replacement;  
* location of air filters;  
* if there are no filters  on extract  terminals,  how ducts  can be accessed  for cleaning and 
recommendations  on how and when cleaning  should  be under  taken;  
* instructions  on how to recalibrate  or check sensors  and their location;  and 
* manufacturer's  literature  that may include  information such  as a spare  parts  list, means of 
obtaining spare  parts,  guarantees  etc. 
* A copy  of the commissioning  and testing  report  for the mechanical  elements  of the 
ventilation  system.  
Information  on the type of system  installed  and on how to operate  it effectively  should also be 
provided,  written  in non-technical  language,  in a section  on ventilation  within  the Quick Start  
Guide  required under  standard 6.8. 
3.14.9  Ventilation  of conservatories  
With large  areas  of glazing,  conservatories  attract large  amounts  of the sun's  radiation that 
can create unacceptable heat build- up. Efficient ventilation therefore is very important to 
ensure a comfortable environment. A conservatory should have a ventilator or ventilators 
################# - Page 244 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 244 Applicable from 5  June 2023   with an opening  area of at least  1/5th of the floor area it serves.  Although  this is the minimum 
recommended area,  a greater  area can provide more  comfortable conditions  particularly  in 
sunny  weather.  
Notwithstanding the recommended opening height of 1.75 m for ventilators, high level or roof  
vents  are best placed to minimise  the effects  of heat build-up and reduce  stratification.  
3.14.10  Ventilation  of areas designated  for drying  of washing 
Where clothes  are dried  naturally  indoors  large  quantities  of moisture  can be released and this 
will need to be removed before it can damage the building.  Normally  a utility  room  or bathroom  
is used and mechanical  extract  is the usual  method of removing moisture.  
Where a space other than a wet room already provided with mechanical extract is 
designated,  that space should be provided with mechanical  extraction  capable of at least  15 
l/s intermittent  operation.  The extract  fan serving  a designated space should  be connected 
through a humidistat set to activate when the relative humidity is above a set value of 
between 50% and  65%.  
Guidance to Standard 3.11 gives  information  on the space  recommended for the drying of 
washing.  
3.14.11  Conservatories  and extensions  built  over  existing windows  
Constructing a conservatory or extension over an existing window, or ventilator, will 
effectively  result  in the creation of an internal  room,  restricting  air movement  which  could 
significantly  reduce natural  ventilation  to that room.  Reference should be made  to clause 
3.16.2  relating to natural  lighting,  and to the guidance to Standards  3.21 and 3.22 on the 
ventilation of combustion appliances, as this also may be relevant. There are other 
recommendations  in Section 2: Fire relating to escape  from inner  rooms.  
Conservatories - A conservatory  may be constructed  over a ventilator  serving  a room  in a 
dwelling  provided that the ventilation of the conservatory  is to the outside air and has an 
opening area of at least 1/20th of the total combined floor area of the internal room so 
formed and the conservatory.  The ventilator  to the internal  room  should  have an opening area 
of at least  1/20th of the floor area of the room.  Background ventilators  should also be provided 
relevant to the overall areas  created.  
Extensions  - An extension  may also be built over a ventilator  but a new ventilator  should be 
provided to the room.  Where this is not practicable,  e.g. where there  is no external  wall, the 
new extension should be treated as part of the existing room rather than the creation of a 
separate internal  room  because the extension  will be more  airtight  than a conservatory  and 
therefore the rate of air change will be compromised.  The opening area between  the 2 parts of  
the room  should be not less than 1/10th of the total combined  area of the existing room and 
the extension.  
Moisture  producing areas - If the conservatory  or extension is constructed over an area that 
generates moisture, such as a kitchen, bathroom, shower room or utility room, mechanical 
extract, via a duct if necessary (or a passive stack ventilation) should be provided direct to 
the outside air. Any existing system disadvantaged by the work may require to be altered to 
ensure supply  and extracted  air is still to the outside air.

Page 245 Applicable from 5  June 2023   3.14.12  Control of  legionellosis  
An inlet to, and an outlet  from,  a mechanical  ventilation  system  should be installed  such  that 
their positioning avoids  the contamination  of the air supply  to the system.  The system  should 
be constructed and installed in accordance with the recommendations in Legionnaires' 
Disease: The control of legionella bacteria in water systems - approved code of practice 
and guidance - HSE L8, in order to ensure, as far as is reasonably practicable, the 
avoidance of contamination by  legionella.  
3.14.13  Ventilation of  garages 
The principal  reason  for ventilating  garages  is to protect  the building  users  from the harmful 
effects  of toxic emissions  from vehicle  exhausts.  Where a garage is attached to a dwelling, the 
separating construction should be as air tight as possible. Where there is a communicating 
door airtight seals should be provided or a lobby arrangement may be appropriate.  
Large  garages - Few domestic  garages  over 60 m2 in area are constructed  but guidance on 
such  structures  is provided in the non-domestic  Technical  Handbook.  
Small  garages - Garages  of less than 30 m2 do not require the ventilation to be designed.  It is 
expected that a degree of fortuitous ventilation is created by the imperfect fit of 'up and over' 
doors or pass doors. With such garages, it is inadvisable for designers to attempt to achieve 
an airtight  construction.  
Open- flued  appliances  - Although not considered  good  practice,  open- flued combustion 
appliances  are installed  in garages.  Ventilation should be provided  in accordance with the 
guidance to Standards  3.21 and 3.22.  
A garage with a floor area of at least 30 m2 but not more than 60 m2 used for the parking of 
motor vehicles should have provision for natural or mechanical ventilation. Ventilation 
should be provided in accordance with the following guidance:  
a. where the garage is naturally ventilated, by providing at  least 2 permanent ventilators, 
each with an open area of at least 1/3000th of the floor area they serve, positioned to 
encourage through ventilation with one of the permanent ventilators being not more 
than 600 mm above floor level, or  
b. where the garage is  mechanically ventilated, by providing a system:  
* capable of continuous operation, designed to provide at least 2 air changes per 
hour, and 
* independent of any other ventilation system, and  
* constructed so that two- thirds of the exhaust air is extracted from outlets not more 
than 600 mm above floor level.

Page 246 Applicable from 5  June 2023   3.15 Condensation  
Mandatory Standard  
Standard 3.15  
Every building must be designed and constructed in such a way that there will 
not be a threat to the building or the health of the occupants as a result of  
moisture caused by surface or interstitial condensation.  
 
 
3.15.0  Introduction 
Condensation can occur in heated buildings when water vapour, usually produced by the 
occupants and their activities, condenses on exposed building  surfaces (surface 
condensati on) where it supports mould growth, or within building elements (interstitial 
condensation).  
The occurrence of condensation is governed by complex interrelationships between 
heating, ventilation, moisture production, building layout and properties of mater ials. 
Condensation need not always be a problem, for example it regularly occurs on the inner 
surface of the outer leaf of a cavity wall which receives very much more water from driving 
rain. However excess condensation can damage the building fabric and c ontents and the 
dampness associated with mould growth can be a major cause of respiratory allergies.  
Condensation can also affect thermal insulation materials as the measured thermal 
performance reduces with increased moisture content. For all of the above reasons the 
control of condensation is an important consideration in building design and construction.  
There are buildings designed and constructed for specialist activities, controlled 
environments or factory processes that normally involve high hum idity levels. The 
guidance to this standard may not be fully appropriate for such buildings as their design is 
generally by specialists and often involves distinctive construction methods and materials 
required to produce buildings that are fit for purpose under the known conditions.  
The effects of climate change may exacerbate problems of condensation in buildings 
due to higher relative humidity. Higher winter temperatures combined with increased 
vapour pressures could result in more severe problems, parti cularly in roof spaces. Very 
careful consideration of the issues is essential and the correct detailing will therefore be 
critical.  
Conversions - in the case of conversions, as specified in regulation 4, the building as 
converted must be improved to as close to the requirement of that standard as is 
reasonably practicable, and in no case be worse than before the conversions (regulation 
12, schedule 6).  
3.15.1  Condensation 
A dwelling should be constructed to reduce the risk of both interstitial and surface 
condensation in order to prevent damage to the fabric and harmful effects on the health of 
people using the dwelling. The guidance given in BS 5250: 2002 'Code of Practice for  the 
################# - Page 247 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 247 Applicable from 5  June 2023   control of condensation in buildings' is helpful in preventing both interstit ial and surface 
condensation.  
3.15.2  Control of  humidity  
If the average relative humidity within a room stays at or above 70% for a long period of 
time, the localised relative humidity at the external wall will be higher and is likely to 
support the germin ation and growth of moulds.  
The fundamental principle of designing to control humidity is to maintain a balance 
between, the thermal and vapour properties of the structure, heat input and ventilation 
rate. The thermal and vapour properties of the structure are covered in Standard 3.15 and 
heat input in Section 6, Energy.  
The kitchen, bathroom and utility room are the 3 areas in a dwelling where most moisture 
is generated. Control of this moisture can be by active or passive means. Guidance to 
Standard 3.14 provides various methods of controlling humidity in high humidity areas.  
3.15.3  Control of condensation in roofs  
Section 8.4 of BS 5250: 2002 provides guidance on the control of condensation in the 
principal forms of roof construction. Clause 8.4.1 of BS 5 250 lists various issues that 
should be considered in the design of roofs to reduce the possibility of excess 
condensation forming that might damage the building and endanger the health of the 
occupants. However cold, level -deck roofs, should be avoided because interstitial 
condensation is likely and its effect on the structure and insulation can be severe and 
many instances of failure in such systems have been recorded. It is considered that more 
reliable forms of construction are available. Both the warm deck and warm deck inverted 
roof constructions, where the insulation is placed above the roof deck, are considered 
preferable. However fully supported metal roof finishes including aluminium, copper, lead, 
stainless steel and zinc are regularly used in conversion work, and they should have a 
ventilated air space on the cold side of the insulation in addition to a high performance 
vapour control layer near the inner surface. Further information may be obtained from the 
relevant metal associations.  
3.15.4  Surface condensation -  thermal  bridging 
Thermal bridging occurs when the continuity of the building fabric is broken by the 
penetration of an element allowing a significantly higher heat loss than its surroundings. 
These 'bridges' commonly occur around openings such as lintels, jambs and sills and at 
wall/roof junctions, wall/floor junctions and where internal walls penetrate the outer fabric. 
Thermal bridges provide a ready passage of heat transfer to the outside air and allow a 
heat flow entirely disproporti onate to their surface area resulting in excessive heat losses. 
Condensation may occur on the inner surfaces that can damage the dwelling or threaten 
the health of the occupants.  
To minimise the risk of condensation on any inner surface, cold bridging at a  floor, wall, 
roof or other building element should be avoided. Detailing should be in accordance with 
the recommendations in Section 8 of BS 5250: 2002. Also, to maintain an adequate 
internal surface temperature and thus minimise the risk of surface conde nsation, it is 
################# - Page 248 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 248 Applicable from 5  June 2023   recommended that the thermal transmittance (U -value) of any part and at any point of the 
external fabric does not exceed 1.2 W/m2k. 
Further guidance on acceptable thermal insulation may be obtained from BRE Report, BR 
262, Thermal insulation: avoiding risks.  
3.15.5  Interstitial  condensation 
A floor, wall, roof or other building element should minimise the risk of interstitial 
condensation in any part of a dwelling that it could damage. Walls, roofs and floors should 
be assessed and/ or constructed in accordance with Section 8 and Annex D of BS 5250: 
2002.  
3.15.6  Roof constructions  (flat)  
For the control of condensation in roofs, including cold deck roofs, BS 5250: 2002 provides 
guidance on the principal forms of construction. There is  evidence that suggests that 
condensation in cold deck flat roofs is a problem. They should be avoided therefore 
because interstitial condensation is likely and its effect on the structure and insulation can 
be severe. Many instances of failure in such sys tems have been recorded and it is 
considered that more reliable forms of construction are available. However fully supported 
metal roof finishes including aluminium, copper, lead, stainless steel and zinc are regularly 
used in conversion work, and they should have a ventilated air space on the cold side of 
the insulation in addition to a high performance vapour control layer near the inner surface. 
Further information may be obtained from the relevant metal associations.  
Both the warm deck and warm deck inv erted roof constructions, where the insulation is 
placed above the roof deck, are considered preferable.  
3.15.7  Roof constructions  (pitched)  
Ventilation is vital for preventing excessive build- up of condensation in cold, pitched roof 
spaces. Where the insulation is at ceiling level the roof space should be cross ventilated. 
Special care should be taken with ventilation where ceilings following the roof pitch. The 
recommendations in BS 5250: 2002 should be followed.

Page 250 Applicable from 5  June 2023   3.16 Natural  lighting 
Mandatory Standard  
Standard 3.16  
Every building must be designed and constructed in such a way that natural 
lighting is provided to ensure that the health of the occupants is not threatened.  
Limitation:  
This standard applies only to a dwelling.  
 
 
3.16.0  Introduction 
The purpose of this standard is primarily to ensure that an adequate standard of day 
lighting is attained in habitable rooms in dwellings to allow domestic activities to be carried 
out conveniently and safely. A kitchen or toilet is not deemed to be a habi table room in 
terms of the building regulations . 
Conversions - in the case of conversions, as specified in regulation 4, the building as 
converted must be improved to as close to the requirement of that standard as is 
reasonably practicable, and in no case worse than before the conversion (regulation 12, 
schedule 6).  
3.16.1  Natural lighting provision 
Every apartment should have a translucent glazed opening, or openings, of an aggregate 
glazed area equal to at least 1/15th of the floor area of the apartment and located in an 
external wall or roof or in a wall between the apartment and a conservatory.  
3.16.2  Conservatories  
A conservatory may be constructed over a translucent glazed opening to a room in a 
dwelling provided that the area of the glazed opening of  the internal room so formed is at 
least 1/15th of the floor area of the internal room. There are other recommendations 
relating to ventilation in clause 3.14.8 and the size of windows in Section 6, Energy.  
3.16.3  Extensions  
An extension however constructed over a glazed opening to a room, because of its greater 
solidity, can seriously restrict daylight from entering the dwelling and the existing room and 
extension should be treated a single room.  
The area of the translucent glazed opening to the extension  should be at least 1/15th of 
the combined floor area of the existing room and the extension. A new translucent glazed 
opening should be provided to the existing room but, where this is not practicable, the wall 
separating the 2 rooms should be opened up t o provide a single space.  
################# - Page 251 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 251 Applicable from 5  June 2023   To ensure sufficient 'borrowed light' is provided, the opening area between the existing 
room and the extension should be not less than 1/10th of the total combined area of the 
existing room and the extension. Clause 3.14.8, covering ventilation, also recommends 
that the existing room and extension are treated as a single space.

Page 252 Applicable from 5  June 2023   3.17  Combustion appliances - safe operation  
Mandatory Standard  
Standard 3.17  
Every building must be designed and constructed in such a way that each fixed 
combustion appliance installation operates safely.  
 
 
3.17.0  Introduction 
The guidance to this standard covers general issues and should be read in conjunction 
with Standards 3.18 to 3.22 that are intended to reduce the risk from combustion 
appli ances and their flues from:  
* endangering the health and safety of persons in and around a building 
* compromising the structural stability of a building, and  
* causing damage by fire.  
The incorrect installation of a heating appliance or design and installation of a flue can 
result in situations leading directly to the dangers noted above.  
The installation of mechanical extract fans is not in itself dangerous but guidance on their 
use has been included under this standard as their use with open- flued appliances c an 
cause problems. Extract fans lower the pressure in a building and this can cause the 
spillage of combustion products from open- flued appliances. This can occur even if the 
appliance and the fan are in different rooms. Combustion appliances therefore should be 
capable of operating safely whether or not any fan is running (see clause 3.17.8).  
Biomass as a solid fuel comes in different forms with the most common being woody 
biomass. Wood burning appliance technologies are such that modern appliances are now  
designed to efficiently burn specific wood fuel types including logs, wood chips, wood 
pellets and wood thinnings.  
Guidance that is given for solid fuel appliance installations may also be appropriate for 
biomass appliance installations however, depending on the complexity of the system there 
may additional issues to consider particularly in relation to safety, noise, flue sizing, 
ventilation and fuel storage.  
There is other legislation that relates to gas fittings, appliances, installations and their 
maintenance and to the competency of persons who undertake such work (see clause 
3.17.6).  
Conversions - in the case of c onversions, as specified in regulation 4, the building as 
converted shall meet the requirement of this standard (regulation 12, schedule 6).

Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 253 Applicable from 5  June 2023   3.17.1  Combustion appliance installations  generally 
This guidance has been prepared mainly with domestic sized i nstallations in mind, such as 
those comprising space and water heating or cooking facilities, including their flues. The 
guidance also includes flueless appliances such as gas cookers.  
 
The guidance to Standards 3.17 to 3.22 therefore applies to solid fuel  appliances with an 
output rating not more than 50 kW, oil -firing appliances with an output rating not more than 
45 kW and gas -fired appliances with a net input rating not more than 70 kW.  
3.17.2  Large combustion appliance  installations  
It is expected that  specialists will design non -domestic sized combustion appliance 
installations in accordance with general standards provided in the Practice Standards 
produced by the British Standards Institution (BS EN or BS) and the Institution of Gas 
Engineers or the D esign Guide produced by the Chartered Institution of Building Service 
Engineers (CIBSE). A few large dwellings may require such installations.  
The following guidance therefore, may not be relevant to solid fuel appliances with an 
output rating more than 50  kW, oil -firing appliances with an output rating more than 45 kW 
and gas -fired appliances with a net input rating more than 70 kW.  
3.17.3  Small combustion appliance  installations  
An installation is only as good as its weakest part and it is necessary to ensure that the 
entire installation is safely constructed and installed.  
Where a combustion appliance installation is intended to operate with more than one type 
of fuel, for example a gas appliance as a stand- by to a solid fuel appliance, each 
component sho uld be constructed and installed to meet the most onerous requirement of 
the relevant fuel.  
3.17.4  Solid fuel appliance  installations  
Solid fuel appliances should be fit for purpose for the type of fuel burnt and all solid fuel 
appliance installations should be constructed and installed carefully to ensure that the 
entire installation operates safely. Installations should be constructed and installed in 
accordance with the requirements of BS 8303: 2018.  
Wood pellet burning stoves and boilers are generally d esigned and constructed with high 
levels of automation, to be very efficient and with low emissions. Wood pellet burning 
appliances can appear similar to other wood fuelled appliances however they are normally 
designed and manufactured specifically for the combustion of wood pellets fuels only. BS 
EN 14785: 2006 'Residential Space Heating Appliances Fired By Wood Pellets' provides 
details on the requirements and test methods.  
Other standards that are applicable to biomass appliances are:  
* BS EN 12809: 2001 ' Residential Independent Boilers Fired by Solid Fuel'  
* BS EN 13229: 2001 'Inset Appliances Including Open Fires Fired by Solid Fuels'  
* BS EN 13240: 2001 'Room Heaters Fired by Sold Fuel'

The Heating Equipment Testing and Approval Scheme (HETAS) is an independent 
organisation for setting standards of safety, efficiency and perform ance for testing and 
approval of solid fuels, solid mineral fuel and wood burning appliances and associated 
equipment and services for the UK solid fuel domestic heating industry. It operates a 
registration scheme for competent Engineers and Companies work ing in the domestic 
solid fuel market. The Official Guide to Approved Solid Fuel Products and Services 
published by HETAS Ltd  contains a list of Registered Heating Engineers deemed 
competent in the various modules listed, e.g. for the installation, inspection and 
maintenance of solid fuel appliances.  
There are other organisations representing the solid fuel industry but neither they nor 
HETAS have a mandatory status.  
3.17.5  Oil-firing appliance  installations  
The Oil Firing Technical Association  (OFTEC) sets equipment standards, installation 
practice and technician competence within the oil firing industry. It publishes technical 
guidance, operates a registration scheme for competent technicians and companies and 
an equipment testing and approval  scheme. OFTEC schemes and technical advice only 
have mandatory status when specifically referred to in legislation.  
Oil-firing appliances should be constructed, installed, commissioned and serviced carefully 
to ensure that the entire installation operates  safely. Oil -firing equipment should be 
suitable for its purpose and the class of oil used in the installation. Oil -firing equipment 
should comply with the relevant OFTEC standard and should be installed in accordance 
with the recommendations in BS 5410: P arts 1 and 2.  
Fire valves should be fitted so as to cut off the supply of oil remotely from the combustion 
appliance in the event of a fire starting in or around the appliance. The valve should be 
located externally to the dwelling. The valve should be fit ted in accordance with the 
recommendations in Section 8.3 of BS 5410: Part 1: 1997 and OFTEC Technical Book 3.  
3.17.6  Gas-fired appliance  installations  
In addition to the functional standards, gas -fired appliance installations must also comply 
with the Gas  Safety (Installation and Use) Regulations 1998. These regulations require 
that, amongst others, gas -fired installations are installed by a competent person. Guidance 
on the individual competency required in given in the Health and Safety Commission's 
Appr oved Code of Practice 'Standards of Training in Safe Gas Installations'. The Gas Safe 
Register  operates a registration scheme for gas businesses and individual gas operatives 
to ensure that they carry out their work in a competent manner. It is the only scheme 
recognised by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) that complies with the Gas Safety 
(Installation and Use) Regulations 1998.  
The Gas Safety (Installations and Use) Regulations 1998 regulates gas installations while 
the Gas Appliance (Safety) Regulations 1995 address the product safety of appliances.

Where a hearth, fireplace (including a flue box), or system chimney is provided, extended 
or altered, i nformation essential to the correct application and use of these facilities should 
be permanently posted in the dwelling to alert future workmen to the specification of  
the installed system. This also applies to cases where a flue liner is provided as part  of 
refurbishment work.  
The labels should be indelibly marked and contain the following information:  
a. the location of the hearth, fireplace (or flue box) or the location of the beginning of the 
flue 
b. a chimney designation string in accordance with BS EN 1443 : 2003 (see clause 
3.18.2) for products whose performance characteristics have been assessed in 
accordance with a European Standard and that has been supplied and marked with a 
designation as described in the relevant European Standard  
c. the category of the flue and generic types of appliance that can safely be 
accommodated  
d. the type and size of the flue (or its  liner)  
e. the installation date.  
Labels should be located in a position that will not easily be obscured such as adjacent to:  
* the gas or electricity mete r, or 
* the water supply stopcock, or  
* the chimney or hearth described.

Page 256 Applicable from 5  June 2023   3.17.8  Extract  fans 
Extract fans lower the pressure in a dwelling and may cause the spillage of combustion 
products from open- flued appliances. This can occur even if the appliance and the fan are 
in different rooms. Ceiling fans produce currents and hence local depressurisation that can  
also cause the spillage of flue gases. The presence of some fans may be obvious, such as 
those on view in kitchens, but others may be less obvious. Fans installed in appliances 
such as tumble dryers or other open- flued combustion appliances can also contr ibute to 
depressurisation. Fans may also be provided to draw radon gas out of the under building.  
In dwellings where it is intended to install open- flued combustion appliances and extract 
fans, the combustion appliances should be able to operate safely whether or not the fans 
are running.  
The installation of extract fans should be in accordance with the guidance below, and 
should be tested to show that combustion appliances operate safely whether or not fans 
are running:  
a. for solid fuel appliances, extract v entilation should not generally be installed in the 
same room or alternatively seek further guidance from HETAS. However in certain 
cases, such as large rooms where there is free flowing replacement air, a fan may be 
fitted provided a satisfactory spillage test is carried out in accordance with BRE 
Information Paper IP 7/94  
b. for oil -firing appliances, limit fan capacities as described in OFTEC Technical Book 3 
and then carry out flue draught interference tests as described in Book 3 or BS  5410: 
Part 1: 1997  
c. for a gas -fired appliance, where a kitchen contains an open- flued appliance, the 
extract rate of the fan should not exceed 20 litres/second. To check for safe operation 
of the appliance(s) the recommendations in clause 5.3.2.3 of BS 5440: Part 1: 2000 
should be followed.

Page 257 Applicable from 5  June 2023   3.18 Combustion appliances -  protection from 
combustion  products  
Mandatory Standard  
Standard 3.18  
Every building must be designed and constructed in such a way that any 
component part of each fixed combustion appliance installation used for the 
removal of combustion gases will withstand heat generated as a result of  its 
operation without any structural change that would impair the stability or 
performance of the installation.  
 
 
3.18.0  Introduction 
The fire service attends many calls t o chimney fires and other fires where a chimney 
defect has allowed fire spread into a building. Whilst the guidance in this standard cannot 
prevent fires, the structural precautions recommended help to limit the damage to flues 
and thus prevent fire from s preading into the building.  
It is essential that flues continue to function effectively when in use without allowing the 
products of combustion to enter the building. Chimneys and flue- pipes are now tested to 
harmonised European standards to establish thei r characteristics relative to safe 
operation.  
Very low flue -gas temperatures are achieved by modern, high efficiency appliances, 
particularly during night conditions, thus causing condensation. Materials need to 
withstand these aggressive situations.  
Expla nation of terms - The following terms are included to provide clarity to their meaning 
in this Technical Handbook.  
Chimney - a structure enclosing 1 or more flues, but not a flue- pipe, and including any 
openings for the accommodation of a combustion appliance, but does not include a 
chimney terminal  
Custom -built chimney -  chimney that is installed or built on- site using a combination of 
compatible chimney components that may be from 1 or different sources  
Double -walled chimney - chimney consisting of a flue liner and an outer wall  
Factory -made chimney - see system chimneys 
Flue - passage for conveying the products of combustion to the outside atmosphere  
Flue-block - factory -made chimney components with 1 or more flues  
Flue liner -  wall of a chimney consisting of components the surface of which is in contact 
with products of combustion  
Flue-pipe - (correctly termed 'connecting flue -pipe') is a pipe, either single walled 
(insulated or non- insulated) or double- walled, that connects a combustion applianc e to a 
flue in a chimney  
################# - Page 258 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 258 Applicable from 5  June 2023   Single -walled chimney - chimney where the flue liner is the chimney  
System chimneys -  (factory -made chimney) chimney that is installed using a combination 
of compatible chimney components, obtained or specified from one manufacturi ng source 
with product responsibility for the whole chimney.  
Some of these terms are explained in greater depth later in the guidance to this standard.  
Conversions - in the case of conversions, as specified in regulation 4, the building as 
converted shall meet the requirement of this standard (regulation 12, schedule 6).  
3.18.1  Chimneys  generally 
Combustion appliances are very often changed after the original installation. Unless an 
appliance is supplied to be used with a specified system chimney or with an integral duct 
assembly, e.g. balanced flue, it is desirable, and sometimes more economical, to cater 
initially for the most severe conditions as regards the danger of fire, generally a traditional 
open fire, and to ensure that all components are compatibl e. 
Combustion appliances, other than flueless appliances such as gas cookers, should 
incorporate, or be connected to, a flue- pipe and/or a chimney that will withstand the heat 
generated by the normal operation of the appliance. A chimney of a higher specif ication 
than the designation strings given (see clause 3.18.2) may be used if required, such as a 
chimney generally suitable for use with an open- flued solid fuel appliance may be used 
with an open flued gas -fired appliance.  
The National Association of Chimney Engineers  (NACE) was set up to ensure the safety of 
all fuel users who depend upon a chimney or flue for the operation of a heating appliance. 
They provide a register of competent and qualified chimney engineers for all types of 
chimney work. Advice is also available from the British Flue and Chimney Manufacturers' 
Association  (BFCMA). These organisations do not have a mandatory status.  
Sweeping chimneys - the process of burning will naturally c ause deposits of soot in the 
flue. Chimneys and flue- pipes therefore should be swept at least annually if smokeless 
solid fuel is burnt and more often if wood, peat and/or other high volatile solid fuel such as 
bituminous coal is burnt. Mechanical sweeping with a brush is the recommended method 
of cleaning.  
Every chimney should have such capacity, be of a height and location and with an outlet 
so located that the products of combustion are discharged freely and will not present a fire 
hazard.  
A flue should be free from obstructions. The surface of the flue should be essentially 
uniform, gas -tight and resistant to corrosion from combustion products. Chimneys should 
be constructed in accordance with:  
a. the recommendations of BS 6461: Part 1: 1984 for masonry chi mneys,  or 
b. the recommendations of BS 7566: Parts 1 -  4: 1992 for metal system chimneys,  or 
c. BS 5410: Part 1: 1997 and OFTEC Technical Book 3, where serving an oil -firing 
appliance, or  
d. BS 5440: Part 1: 2000, where serving a gas -fired appliance.

Page 259 Applicable from 5  June 2023   3.18.2  Chimne y designations  
Designations for chimneys, according to BS EN 1443: 2003, are dependant on the fuel to 
be used, the type of appliance and the operating conditions. The designation string 
prescribes limiting values or categories for temperature, pressure, condensate resistance, 
corrosion resistance, soot fire resistance and distance to combustibles. Values for  
which the chimney is suitable are specified by the system chimney manufacturer or the 
designer of a custom built or re- lined chimney. For a new chimney  installation the chimney 
designation should be chosen to suit the intended appliance installation. For an existing 
chimney the appliance performance should be chosen to match the designation of the 
chimney. Advice on the appropriate chimney specification should be sought from the 
appliance manufacturer.  
The recommended designation for chimneys and flue- pipes for use with natural draught, 
solid fuel appliances is T400 N2 D 3 Gxx.  
The recommended designation for chimneys and flue- pipes for use with forced dr aught 
solid fuel appliances that have a positive pressure at the outlet of the appliance is T400 P2 
D 3 Gxx.  
The pressure designation P2 is regarded as the default specification. However the 
chimney can often generate an adequate natural draught, so that the appliance can be 
safely used with chimneys and flue- pipes with the negative pressure designation even if 
the appliance is fanned. The draught generated in a chimney may be calculated according 
to BS EN 13384- 1: 2002. If there is any doubt, and/or unless the appliance manufacturer 
specifies N2, the designation P2 should apply.

appliances  Class D T160 N2 W 2 Oxx  
Additional information:  
The pressure designation N2 is regarded as the most likely specification to apply in the oil 
industry for both vaporising and pressure jet appliances. Most pressure jet appliances only 
generate adequate pressure to overcome flow resistance within the appli ance so that the 
products of combustion entering the chimney will be at a negative pressure with respect to 
the atmosphere. Thus the appliance can be safely used with chimneys and flue- pipes with 
negative pressure designation. In the event that an applianc e design produces a positive 
pressure at the outlet of the appliance, it is the manufacturer's responsibility to inform the 
################# - Page 260 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 260 Applicable from 5  June 2023   installer that a chimney with a positive designation should be used. If there is any doubt, 
the more onerous designation P2 should apply.  
The appliance manufacturer's instructions should always be checked. They may specify a 
higher designation.  
Table 3.8 Recommended designation for chimneys and flue -pipes for use with gas 
appliances

SE duct T450 N2 D 1 Oxx  
Additional information:  
The pressure designation P2 is regarded as the default specification. However the 
chimney can often generate an adequate natural draught, so that the appliance can be 
safely used with chimneys and flue- pipes with the negative pressure designation even for 
many fanned draught gas appliances, including condensing boilers that may otherwise 
have positive pressure at the outlet to the flue. The draught generated in a chimney may 
be calculated according to BS EN 13384- 1: 2002. If there is any doubt, and/or unless the 
appliance manufacturer specifies N2, the designation P2 should apply.  
3.18.3  Masonry  chimneys  
A new masonry chimney, usually custom -built on site, and normally with an outer wall of 
brick, block or stone, should be well constructed and incorporate a flue liner, or flue- blocks, 
of either clay material or precast concrete. A masonry chimney should be const ructed in 
accordance with the recommendations in BS 6461: Part 1: 1984. If an outer wall is 
constructed of concrete it should be constructed in accordance with BS EN 12446: 2003.  
It is a complex operation to upgrade the chimney at a later date to serve a new appliance 
that needs a higher classification of chimney to operate safely, thus a chimney designed 
for solid fuel will also serve for oil or gas. See clause 3.18.6 for guidance on flue liners.  
Chimneys can also be constructed of prefabricated block components, designed for  quick 
construction. Chimney components such as cappings, offsets and precast fireplace 
components are available with this type of system. Some flue- blocks are specially 
designed for gas -fired appliances only. Flue- blocks should be constructed and installed in 
accordance with recommendations in:  
a. BS EN 1858: 2003, for a precast concrete flue- block chimney  
################# - Page 261 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 261 Applicable from 5  June 2023   b. BS EN 1806: 2006, for a clay flue- block  chimney.  
3.18.4  Metal  chimneys 
Metal chimneys may be either single- walled or double- walled. Ea ch of these types is 
commonly factory -made by one manufacturer as sets of components for easy assembly on 
site (although they can be supplied as 1 unit) and is thus a system chimney. A choice of 
fittings such as bends, brackets, and terminals are available.  
Some metal chimneys are specifically designed for use with gas -fired appliances and 
should not be used for solid fuel appliances because of the higher temperatures and 
greater corrosion risk.  
Metal system chimneys, with the following designations, should  be constructed in 
accordance with the recommendations in BS EN 1856- 1: 
a. T400 N1 D V3 (or Vm -  Lxxxxx) Gxx, for solid fuel appliances  
b. T400 P2 D V3 (or Vm -  Lxxxxx) Gxx where it serves an oil -firing appliance producing a 
flue gas temperature of not more than 400oC, e.g. burning Class D oil (gas  oil) 
c. T250 N2 D V2 (or Vm -  Lxxxxx) Oxx where it serves an oil -firing appliance producing a 
flue gas temperature of not more than 250oC, e.g. burning Class C2 oil  (kerosene)  
d. T250 N2 D V1 (or Vm -  Lxxxxx) Oxx where it serves a gas appliance.  
The corrosion resistance may be specified, according to BS EN 1856- 1, by:  
a. a corrosion test method, which leads to a value of either V1, V2 or V3, or  
b. by a material specification code Vm -  Lxxxxx where the first 2 digits represent a 
material type as quoted in BS EN 1856- 1, Table 4 and the last 3 digits represent the 
material thickness.  
Acceptable material specificati ons may be taken from the national Annex to BS EN 1856-
1. For example, an acceptable material code for solid fuel, oil or gas, would be Vm -  
L50040 representing a material type 50 with a thickness of 0.40 mm.  
A metal chimney should not pass through a compartment wall, compartment floor, 
separating wall or separating floor. However they may if the chimney, or a non-
combustible casing totally enclosing the chimney, is constructed in such a way that, in the 
event of a fire, the fire resistance of the compartme nt wall, compartment floor, separating 
wall or separating floor is maintained (see Section 2, Fire).  
A metal chimney should only pass through a storage space, cupboard or roof space 
provided any flammable material is shielded from the chimney by a removabl e, imperforate 
casing. Also where the chimney passes through the roof space, such as an attic, it should 
be surrounded be a rigid mesh that will prevent vermin from building a nest beside the 
warm chimney. Mesh should prevent an 8mm diameter sphere from passing.  
There should be no joints within any wall, floor or ceiling that make accessing the chimney 
for maintenance purposes difficult.  
3.18.5  Flue-pipes 
A flue -pipe should be of a material that will safely discharge the products of combustion 
into the flue under all conditions that will be encountered. A flue- pipe serving a solid fuel 
################# - Page 262 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 262 Applicable from 5  June 2023   appliance should be non- combustible and of a material and construction capable of 
withstanding the effects of a chimney fire without any structural change that would impair 
the stability and performance of the flue- pipe.  
Flue-pipes should be manufactured from the materials noted below:  
a. cast iron pipe to BS 41: 1973 (1988)  
b. mild steel at least 3mm thick, to Section 1.1 of BS 1449: Part 1: 1991  
c. vitreous enamelled steel to BS 6999:  1989  
d. stainless steel designated Vm -  L50100, in accordance with BS EN 1856- 2: 2005 or 
Vm - Lxxxxx for oil or gas applications  
e. any other material approved and tested under the relevant conditions of a notified 
body.  
Flue-pipes should have the same diameter  or equivalent cross sectional area as that of the 
appliance flue outlet and should be to the size recommended by the appliance 
manufacturer. It should be noted that oversized flue- pipes can cause condensation 
problems in modern, highly efficient oil and g as fired boilers.  
A flue -pipe connecting a solid fuel appliance to a chimney should not pass through:  
a. a roof space  
b. an internal wall, although it is acceptable to discharge a flue- pipe into a flue in a 
chimney formed wholly or partly by a non- combustible  wall 
c. a ceiling or floor. However it is acceptable for a flue- pipe to pass through a ceiling or 
floor where they are non -combustible and the flue- pipe discharges into a chimney 
immediately above.  
3.18.6  Flue liners  
A flue liner is the wall of the chimney that is in contact with the products of combustion. It 
can generally be of concrete, clay, metal or plastic depending on the designation of the 
application.  
All new chimneys will have flue liners installed and there are several types, as follows:  
* rigid sections of clay or refractory liner  
* rigid sections of concrete liner  
* rigid metal pipes.  
Flue liners suitable for solid fu el appliances, and therefore generally suitable for other 
fuels, should have a performance at least equal to that corresponding to the designation 
T400 N2 D 3 G as described in BS EN 1443: 2003 and manufactured from the following 
materials:  
a. clay flue liner s with rebates or sockets for jointing and meeting the requirements for 
Class A1 N2 or Class A1 N1 as described in BS EN 1457: 1999, or  
b. concrete flue liners meeting the requirements for the classification Type A1, Type A2, 
c. Type B1 or Type B2 as described i n BS EN 1857: 2003, or  
################# - Page 263 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 263 Applicable from 5  June 2023   d. any other material approved and tested under the relevant conditions of a notified 
body.  
Stainless steel flexible flue liners meeting BS EN 1856- 2: 2005 may be used for lining or 
relining flues for oil and gas appliances, and for lining flues for solid fuel applications 
provided that the designation is in accordance with the intended application. These should 
be installed in accordance with their manufacturer's instructions.  
Single skin, stainless steel flexible flue liners may be used for lining flues for gas and oil 
appliances. These should be installed in accordance with their manufacturer's instructions.  
Double skin, stainless steel flexible flue liners for multi -fuel use should be installed in 
accordance with their manufacturer's instructions.  
Existing custom -built masonry chimneys may be lined or re- lined by one of the following 
flue liners:  
* flexible, continuous length, single- skin stainless steel for lining or re- lining chimney 
flues for C2 oil and gas installations designated T250 
* flexible, continuous length, double- skin stainless steel for lining or re- lining systems 
designated T400 for multi -fuel installations  
* insulating concrete pumped in around an inflatable former  
* spray -on or brush- on coating by specialist.  
Existing chimneys for solid fuel applications may also be relined using approved rigid 
metal liners or single- walled chimney products, an approved cast -insitu technique or an 
approved spray -on or brush- on coating. Approved products are listed in the HETAS Guide.  
Masonry liners for use in existing chimneys should be installed in accordance with their 
manufacturer's instructions. Appropriate components should be selected to form the flue 
without cutting and to keep joints to a minimum. Bends and offsets shoul d only be  
formed with factory -made components. Liners should be placed with the sockets or rebate 
ends uppermost to contain moisture and other condensates in the flue. In the absence of 
specific liner manufacturer's instructions to the contrary, the space between the lining and 
the surrounding masonry could be filled with a weak insulating concrete.  
The corrosion resistance of a metal liner may be specified, according to BS EN 1856- 1, 
by either:  
a. a corrosion test method, which leads to a value of either V1, V2 or V3, or  
b. by a material specification code Vm -  Lxxxxx where the first 2 digits represent a 
material type as quoted in BS EN 1856- 1, Table 4 and the last 3 digits represent the 
material thickness.  
Acceptable material specifications may be taken from the national Annex to BS EN 1856-
1. For example, an acceptable material code for solid fuel, oil or gas, would be Vm -  
L50040 representing a material type 50 with a thickness of 0.40 mm.

combustible  materials  
Mand atory Standard  
Standard 3.19  
Every building must be designed and constructed in such a way that any 
component part of each fixed combustion appliance installation will not cause 
damage to the building in which it is installed by radiated, convected or 
conducted heat or from hot embers expelled from the appliance.  
 
 
3.19.0  Introduction 
Combustion appliances and their component parts, particularly solid fuel appliance 
installations, generate or dissipate considerable temperatures. Certain precautions need to 
be taken to ensure that any high temperatures are not sufficient to cause a risk to people 
and the building. The characteristics of solid fuel and some older style oil -firing appliances 
are more onerous than modern oil and gas -fired appliances.  
Conversions - in the case of conversions, as specified in regulation 4, the building as 
converted shall meet the requirements of this standard in so far as is reasonably 
practicable, and in no case be worse than before the conversion (regulation 12, schedule 
6). 
3.19.1  Relationship of masonry chimneys to combustible  material  
Combustible material should not be located where the heat dissipating through the walls of 
fireplaces or flues could ignite it. All combustible materials therefore should be locat ed at 
least 200 mm from the surface surrounding a flue in a masonry chimney. However some 
combustible materials will not be a risk and do not need a 200 mm separation distance nor 
do the flue gasses generated from some appliances reach a sufficiently high temperature 
to require it. The following materials may be located closer than 200 mm to the surface 
surrounding a flue in a  chimney:  
* a damp proof course(s) firmly bedded in mortar  
* small combustible fixings may be located not less than 150 mm from the surface of the 
flue 
* combustible structural material may be located not less than 40 mm from the outer 
face of a masonry  chimney  
* flooring, strapping, sarking, or similar combustible material may be located on the outer 
face of a masonry  chimney.  
* Any metal fastening in contact with combustible material, such as a joist hanger, 
should be at least 50 mm from the surface surrounding a flue to avoid the possibility of 
the combustible material catching fire due to conduction.

System chimneys do not necessarily require to be located at such a distance from 
combustible material. It is the responsibility of the chimney manufacturer  to declare a 
distance 'XX', as stipulated in BS EN 1856- 1: 2003 and BS EN 1858: 2003 as being a safe 
distance from the chimney to combustible material. At this distance, the temperature of 
adjacent combustible materials during operation of the appliance at its rated output should 
not exceed 85oC when related to an ambient temperature of 20oC.  
Figure 3.39 Plan of casing round a factory -made chimney  
BS EN 1806: 2000 relates to clay flue -block chimneys but does not give a value for 
distances to combustible m aterials. These types of chimneys therefore should be regarded 
as a custom built chimneys and the minimum values in this clause 3.19.1 or clause 3.19.2 
should be used and declared.

There should be a separation distance where a metal chimney passes through 
combustible material. This is specified, as part of the designation string for a system 
chimney when used for oil or gas, as (Gxx), where xx is the distance in mm. Where no 
data is available, the separation distance for oil or gas applications with a flue gas 
temperature limit of T250 or less should be 25 mm from the outer surface of a single-
walled chimney to combustible material. The 25 mm should be measured from the surface 
of the inner wall of a double-  walled chimney. There is no need for a separation distance if 
the flue gases are not likely to exceed 100 oC.

Page 274 Applicable from 5  June 2023   3.20 Combustion appliances -  removal of 
products of  combustion  
Mandatory Standard  
Standard 3.20  
Every building must be designed and constructed in such a way that the 
products of combustion are carried safely to the external air without harm to the 
health of any person through leakage, spillage, or exhaust nor permit the re-
entry of dangerous gases from the combustion process of fuels into the 
building.  
 
 
3.20.0  Introduction 
The guidance to this standard includes design and construction issues relating to 
chimneys and flues. In 2010- 11 Fire fighters attended 1565 chimney fires in Scotland. The 
main cause of these fires was inadequate maintenance of the chimn eys, including routine 
cleaning of flues.  
Combustion appliances fuelled by solid fuel, oil or gas all have the potential to cause 
carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning if they are poorly installed or commissioned, 
inadequately maintained or incorrectly used. Inad equate ventilation or a lack of the correct 
maintenance of appliances, flues and chimneys are the main causes of CO  poisoning. 
Poisonous CO gas is produced when fuel does not burn properly. Incidents of poisoning 
can also occur through deterioration of the structure of the flue or chimney. Every year in 
Scotland there are fatalities from CO poisoning directly attributed to combustion 
appliances installed in buildings. In addition to these deaths there are also a considerable 
number of incidents where people are treated in hospital for the effects of CO poisoning. In 
some cases CO poisoning can result in serious and perma nent injury to persons affected. 
Where CO gas may occur within a building early detection and warning can play a vital role  
in the protection and safety of the occupants. This is particularly important in buildings with 
sleeping accommodation.  
Incorrect si zing of flues can also have serious repercussions. If a flue is too small, an 
insufficient volume of air will pass through it and this may lead to spillage of combustion 
gases. Too large a flue will slow down the flow of combustion gases and this may also 
lead to spillage.  
The use of fanned flues allows combustion appliances to be located away from external 
walls. In such installations the flues can often be concealed within ceiling or wall voids 
making it difficult to determine whether the flue is still in good condition when an appliance 
is serviced or maintained.  
Damaged or poorly maintained flues can allow CO gases to escape from the flue before 
the intended termination point. Therefore flues passing through a building should be 
minimised. Where it is no t possible to avoid a flue passing through the building the route of 
the flue should be carefully considered to minimise the risk to occupants.

Page 275 Applicable from 5  June 2023   Conversions - in the case of conversions, as specified in regulation 4, the building as 
converted shall meet the requirement of this standard (regulation 12, schedule 6).  
3.20.1  Chimney and flue -pipe serving appliance burning any  fuel 
A chimney or flue- pipe serving any appliance should be suitable for use with the type of 
appliance served. A chimney should be manufactured using products in accordance with 
the following standards:  
a. BS EN 1858: 2003, for concrete chimney blocks,  or 
b. BS EN 1806: 2000, for clay chimney blocks,  or 
c. BS EN 1857: 2003, for purpose made concrete flue linings,  or 
d. BS EN 1457: 1999, for purpose mad e clay flue linings, or  
e. BS EN 1856 -1: 2003, for a factory -made metal chimney, or  
f. a lining accepted for the purpose after testing of the chimney under the relevant 
conditions by a notified body.  
3.20.2  Chimneys and flue -pipes serving solid fuel appliances  
A flue in a chimney should be separated from every other flue and extend from the 
appliance to the top of the chimney. Every flue should be surrounded by non- combustible 
material that is capable of withstanding the effects of a chimney fire, without any str uctural 
change that would impair the stability or performance of the chimney. However the 
chimney may include a damp proof course (or courses) of combustible material.  
3.20.3  Chimneys and flue -pipes serving oil -firing appliances  
A chimney or flue- pipe serv ing an oil -firing appliance should be constructed to the 
recommendations of BS 5410: Part 1: 1997 or OFTEC Technical Book 3 and OFTEC 
Standard OFS E106 as appropriate.  
Satisfactory specification of chimneys and flue- pipes depends upon the gas temperature to 
be expected in normal service. Flue gas temperatures depend upon appliance types and 
the age of their design. Older appliances are likely to produce flue gas temperat ures 
greater than 250 oC while modern boilers that bear the CE mark indicating compliance with 
the Boiler (Efficiency) Regulations 1993 will normally have flue gas temperatures less than 
250 oC. Information for individual appliances should be sought from m anufacturer's 
installation instructions, from the manufacturers themselves or from OFTEC. Where this is 
not available, flues should be constructed for an assumed flue gas temperature of more 
than 250 oC.  
High flue gas temperatures -  where the flue gas temperatures are more than 250 oC, 
under normal working conditions, custom -built chimneys, system chimneys and flue- pipes 
should be designed and constructed for use with a solid fuel appliance.  
Low flue gas temperatures -  where the flue gas temperatures are not more than 250 oC, 
under normal working conditions, chimneys and flue- pipes may be of a lower specification 
as follows:  
a. in accordance with the guidance in clauses 3.18.3, 3.18.4, 3.18.5, relating to gas, and  
################# - Page 276 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 276 Applicable from 5  June 2023   b. where the oil -firing appliance burns Class D fuel, the inner surfaces of the chimney or 
flue-pipe should not be manufactured from  aluminium.  
The flue gas temperatures are quoted in manufacturer's product data and can be 
measured in accordance with OFTEC Appliance Standard OFS A100 for boilers, OFS 
A101  for cookers or OFS A102 for room heaters.  
3.20.4  Chimneys and flue -pipes serving gas -fired appliances  
A chimney or flue- pipe should be constructed and installed in accordance with the 
following recommendations:  
a. BS 5440 -1: 2000 
b. IGE/UP/7: Edition 2, 'Gas In stallation in timber framed and light steel framed 
buildings', where the chimney or flue- pipe is in a timber frame building  
c. the appropriate recommendations of the combustion appliance manufacturer, where 
the flue- pipe is supplied as an integral part of the combustion appliance.  
3.20.5  Oil-firing appliances in bathrooms and bedrooms 
There is an increased risk of carbon monoxide poisoning in bathrooms, shower rooms or 
rooms intended for use as sleeping accommodation, such as bed- sitters. Because of this, 
open- flued oil -firing appliances should not be installed in these rooms or any cupboard or 
compartment connecting directly with these rooms. Where locating a combustion 
appliance in such rooms cannot be avoided, the installation of a room -sealed appliance 
would be appropriate.  
3.20.6  Gas-fired appliances in bathrooms and bedrooms  
Regulation 30 of the Gas Safety (Installations & Use) Regulations 1998 has specific 
requirements for room -sealed appliances in these locations.  
3.20.7  Protection of metal  chimneys 
Meta l chimneys should be guarded if there could be a risk of damage or if they present a 
risk to people that is not immediately apparent such as when they traverse intermediate 
floors out of sight of the appliance.  
Where the metal chimney passes through a room  or accessible space such as a walk -in 
cupboard it should be protected in accordance with the recommendations of:  
* BS EN 12391 -1: 2003, for solid fuel appliances  
* BS 5410: Part 1: 1997, for oil -firing appliances  
* BS 5440: Part 1: 2000, for gas appliances.  
It is not necessary to provide protection where a system chimney runs within the same 
space as the appliance served.

2. Any chimney pot or open- topped terminal must maintain the same cross -sectional 
area as the flue. Any covered terminal should have side outlets with a total free area 
twice that of the  flue. 
3. Specialist advice should be sought when proposing to construct flues with an area of 
more than 120000 mm2 or 15% of the total face area of the fireplace  opening.

3.20.9  Size of flues - oil-firing  appliances 
The cross sectional area of a flue serving an oil-firing appliance should be in accordance 
with the recommendations in BS 5410: Part 1: 1997 and should be the same size as the 
appliance flue spigot.  
3.20.10  Size of flues - gas-fired  appliances 
The area of a flue serving a gas -fired appliance should have a size to ensure safe 
operation. A flue should be provided in accordance with the following recommendations:  
* Clause 9 of BS 5871: Part 3: 2005, for a decorative fuel -effect gas  appliance  
* BS 5871: Part 2: 2005, for an inset live fuel -effect gas appliance  
* BS 5440: Part 1: 2000, for any other gas -fired appliance.  
3.20.11  Design of  flues  
A combustion appliance should be connected to a chimney that discharges to the external 
air. However there are some combustion appliances that are designed not to discharge 
direct to the external air, such as flueless cookers. An opening window, extract fan or 
passive stack ventilation system may be sufficient to ventilate a kitchen but where other 
types of flueless appliances are installed, the manufacturer's instructions sh ould be 
followed.  
Every solid fuel appliance should be connected to a separate flue.  
Every oil -firing appliance should be connected to a separate flue. However this is not 
necessary where all the appliances have pressure jet burners and are connected into a 
shared flue.  
Every gas- fired appliance that requires a flue should connect into a separate flue. 
However in certain instances, appliances can be connected to shared flues, if they are 
installed in accordance with the recommendations in BS 5440: Part 1: 2000.  

################# - Page 280 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 280 Applicable from 5  June 2023   The flue of a natural draught appliance, such as a traditional solid fuel appliance, should 
offer the least resistance to the passage of combustion gases. Resistance can be 
minimised by restricting the number of bends and horizontal runs should only b e 
incorporated on back -entry appliances.  
The horizontal length of the back -entry flue pipe at the point of discharge from the 
appliance should be not more than 150 mm.  
Figure 3.53 Flue -pipe connection to back -entry solid fuel appliance  
 
Where bends are es sential, they should be angled at not more than 45o to the vertical.  
3.20.12  Openings in  flues  
The flue should have no intermediate openings. However it is acceptable to provide a 
draught stabiliser or draft diverter on the chimney provided it is in the same room or space 
as the appliance being served. An explosion door may also be provided.  
3.20.13  Access to  flues  
Access should be provided for inspection and cleaning of the flue and the appliance and 
therefore an opening that is fitted with a non- combustib le, rigid, gas -tight cover would be 
acceptable.  
Adequate provision for inspecting flues that are positioned within a void, for example a 
service duct or above a suspended ceiling, should be provided. Such provisions will allow 
essential safety checks to be  made by engineers when a combustion appliance is worked 
on, both during initial commissioning and any subsequent servicing.  
Access hatches should be 300 mm x 300 mm or larger where necessary to allow sufficient 
access to the void to look along the length of the flue. The number and position of access 
hatches should allow the entire length of the concealed flue to be inspected with at least 
one hatch located within 1.5 m of any joint in the flue system.  
Access hatches are intended for inspection purposes only, it is not intended that they allow 
full physical access to the flue system.

externally to a building, but should be routed inside the building. However a metal chimney 
may be fixed externally if it is insulated and constructed of a material that can be used 
externally, such as stainless steel or, in the case of gas, aluminium, so long as they 
conform to the specifications of t he National Annex to BS EN 1856- 1: 2003.  
3.20.15  Terminal discharges at low  level  
Combustion gasses at the point of discharge can be at a high temperature. Therefore flues 
discharging at low level where they may be within reach of people should be protected 
with a terminal guard.  
A flue terminal should be protected with a guard if a person could come into contact with it 
or if it could be damaged. If the flue outlet is in a vulnerable position, such as where the 
flue discharges within reach of the ground, or a balcony, veranda or window, it should be 
designed to prevent the entry of matter that could obstruct the flow of gases.  
3.20.16  Terminal discharge from condensing  boilers  
The condensate plume from a condensing boiler can cause damage to external surfac es 
of a building if the terminal location is not carefully considered. The manufacturer's 
instructions should be followed.  
3.20.17  Solid fuel appliance flue  outlets  
The outlet from a flue should be located externally at a safe distance from any opening, 
obstruction or flammable or vulnerable materials. The outlets should be located in 
accordance with the following diagram:

3.20.20  Carbon monoxide  detection  
Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colourless, odourless, and tasteless gas. Low levels of CO gas 
can be present in the atmosphere, however, it is highly toxic and dangerous to humans 
and animals in higher quantities. The gas is produced in high levels from appliances where 
incomplete combustion of a carbon based fuel occurs. Incomplete combustion could occur 
in appliance installations that are defective, lack proper maintenance or have inadequate 
provision for combustion air.  
In order to alert occupants to the pres ence of levels of carbon monoxide which may be 
harmful to people, a detection system should be installed in all dwellings where:  
* a new or replacement fixed combustion appliance (excluding an appliance used solely 
for cooking) is installed in the dwelling,  or 
* a new or replacement fixed combustion appliance is installed in an inter -connected 
space, for example, an integral garage.  
Carbon monoxide detectors should comply with BS EN 50291- 1:2010 and be powered  by 
a battery designed to operate for the working l ife of the detector. The detector should 
incorporate a warning device to alert the users when its working life is due to expire. Hard 
wired mains operated carbon monoxide detectors complying with BS EN 50291- 1:2010 
(Type A) with fixed wiring (not plug in t ypes) may be used as an alternative, provided they 
are fitted with a sensor failure warning device.  
Where carbon monoxide detectors are within the scope of either or both:  
* European Directive 2006/95/EC - Low Voltage Directive, and/or  
* European Directive 1999/5/EC - Radio and Telecommunication Terminal Equipment 
Directive  
they should be constructed to fully comply with all applicable safety aspects of the 
Directive(s).  

################# - Page 288 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 288 Applicable from 5  June 2023   The guidance in this clause takes account of the audibility levels in adjoining rooms and 
the effect of carbon monoxide moving throughout the building. Carbon monoxide detectors 
should include an integral sounder.  
A carbon monoxide detection system to alert occupants to the presence of carbon 
monoxide should consist of at least:  
* 1 carbon monoxide detector in every space containing a fixed combustion appliance 
(excluding an appliance used solely for cooking), and  
* 1 carbon monoxide detector to provide early warning to high risk accommodation, that 
is, a bedroom or principal habitable room, where a flue passes through these rooms.  
Unless otherwise indicated by the manufacturer, carbon monoxide detectors should be 
either:  
* ceiling mounted and positioned at least 300 mm from any wall, or  
* wall mounted and positioned at least 150 mm below the ceiling and higher than any 
door or window in the room.  
Carbon monoxide detectors in the space containing the combustion appliance should be 
sited between 1 m and 3 m from the appliance.  
Note: where the combustion appliance is located in a small space it may not be possible to 
locate the detector within that space. In such circumstances the detector may be located at 
the appropriate distance outwith the space.  
A carbon monoxide detector should not be sited:  
* in an enclosed space (for example in a cupboard or behind a curtain)  
* where it can be obstructed (for example by furniture)  
* directly above a sink  
* next to a door or window  
* next to an extract fan  
* next to an air vent or similar ventilation opening 
* in an area where the temperature may drop below - 10degC or exceed 40degC, unless it is 
designed to do so  
* where dirt and dust may block the sensor  
* in a damp or humid location, or  
* in the immediate vicinity of a cooking appliance.  
Additional guidance on the siting of carbon monoxide detectors, including enhanced 
coverage, can be found in BS EN 50292:2002.  
The provision of a carbon monoxide detection system should not be regarded as a 
substitute for the correct installation and regular servicing of a combustion appliance.

Page 289 Applicable from 5  June 2023   3.21 Combustion appliances -  air for combustion  
Mandatory Standard  
Standard 3.21  
Every building must be designed and constructed in such a way that each fixed 
combustion appliance installation receives air for combustion and operation of 
the chimney so that the health of persons within the building is not threatened 
by the build- up of dangerous gases as a result of incomplete combustion.  
 
 
3.21.0  Introduction 
All combustion appliances need ventilation to supply them with oxygen for combustion. 
This air, which must be replaced from outside the dwelling, generally comes from the room 
in which the combustion appliance is located although many appliances are now located in 
specially constructed cupboards or appliance compartments. Ventilation of these 
cupboards or appliance compartments is essential to ensure proper combustion. 
Ventilation is also needed to ensure the proper operation of flues, or in the case of flueless 
appliances, to ensure the products of combustion are safely dispersed to the outside  air. 
Failure to provide adequate replacement air to a room can result in the accumulation of 
poisonous carbon monoxide fumes.  
Conversions - in the case of conversions, as specified in regulation 4, the building as 
converted shall meet the requirement of t his standard (regulation 12, schedule 6).  
3.21.1  Supply of air for combustion generally 
A room containing an open- flued appliance may need permanently open air vents. An 
open- flued appliance needs to receive a certain amount of air from outside dependant 
upon its type and rating. Infiltration through the building fabric may be sufficient but above 
certain appliance ratings permanent openings are necessary.  
Ventilators for combustion should be located so that occupants are not provoked into 
sealing them agai nst draughts and noise. Discomfort from draughts can be avoided by 
placing vents close to appliances e.g. floor vents, by drawing air from intermediate spaces 
such as hallways or by ensuring good mixing of incoming air. Air vents should not be 
located with in a fireplace recess except on the basis of specialist advice. Noise attenuated 
ventilators may be needed in certain circumstances.  
Appliance compartments that enclose open -flued appliances should be provided with 
vents large enough to admit all the air r equired by the appliance for combustion and proper 
flue operation, whether the compartment draws air from the room or directly from outside.  
The installation of a mechanical extract system should be checked against the 
recommendations in clause 3.17.8.

more than 5 kW. (A combustion appliance with an output rating of no t more than 5 kW has no minimum requirement, unless 
stated by the appliance manufacturer).  
Additional information:  
1. THROAT means the contracted part of the flue lying between the fireplace opening 
and the main flue. 
2. Where a draught stabiliser is fitted to a solid fuel appliance, or to a chimney or flue-
pipe in the same room as a solid fuel appliance, additional ventilat ion opening should 
be provided with a free area of at least 300 mm2/kW of solid fuel appliance rated

3. Nominal fire size is related to the free opening width at the front of the fireplace 
opening.  
3.21.3  Supply of air for combustion to oil -firing app liances  
An oil -firing appliance installed in a room or space should have a supply of air for 
combustion by way of permanent ventilation either direct to the open air or to an adjoining 
space which is itself permanently ventilated direct to the open air. Th is also includes a sub-  
floor space. However this may not be necessary if it is a room -sealed appliance. An air

Page 293 Applicable from 5  June 2023   3.23 Fuel storage -  protection from  fire 
Mandatory Standard  
Standard 3.23  
Every building must be designed and constructed in such a way that  
a) an oil storage installation, incorporating oil storage tanks used solely to 
serve a fixed combustion appliance ins tallation providing space heating 
or cooking facilities in a building, will inhibit fire from spreading to the 
tank and its contents from within, or beyond, the boundary  
b) a container for the storage of woody biomass fuel will inhibit fire from 
spreading to its contents from within or beyond the boundary.  
Limitation:  
This standard does not apply to portable containers.  
 
 
3.23.0  Introduction 
The guidance on oil relates only to its use solely where it serves a combustion appliance 
providing space heating or cooking facilities in a building. There is other legislation 
covering the storage of oils for other purposes. Heating oils comprise Class C2 oil 
(kerosene) or Class D oil (gas oil) as specified in BS 2869: 2006.  
It is considered unlikely that a fire will originate from the stored oil. It is the purpose of this 
guidance therefore, to ensure that a fire that may originate from a building, or other 
external source, is not transferred to the tank contents, or if a fire does occur, its effects 
are limited.  
The acceptance of climate change and the environmental policies put in place to mitigate 
its impact are pushing the commercial introduction of renewable energy technologies to 
displace the use of fossil fuels and the related combustion emissions of greenhouse 
gases. Woody biomass can be used as an alternative to fossil fuels and in some EU 
countries biomass fuel is the principal source of renewable energy for heating applications. 
The carbon dioxide emitted when biomass is burnt can be considered to be offset by  the 
carbon dioxide absorbed as trees grow. Whilst this does not compensate for the energy 
used in processing the wood for fuel, the carbon dioxide emissions are considerably less 
than those of fossil fuels.  
The use of woody biomass, in the form of wood chips, wood pellets and logs may offer a 
viable alternative to fossil fuels, particularly in areas not served by the gas grid, although 
the supply and distribution of chips and pellets is, as yet, still developing with increasingly 
more suppliers available.  
Information of the different types of woody biomass fuel can be found on the BSD website  
under:  'Storage of woody biomass fuel for heating equipment'.  
Conversions - in the case of conversions, as specified in regulation 4, the building as 
converted shall meet the requirement of this standard (regulation 12, schedule 6).

Page 294 Applicable from 5  June 2023   3.23.1  Separation of oil tank s from buildings and boundaries  
Every fixed oil tank with a capacity of more than 90 litres should be located at a distance 
from a building to reduce the risk of the fuel that is being stored from being ignited if there 
is a fire in the building. Some fire protection to, or for, the building is required if the oil tank 
is located close to the building. Further guidance may be obtained from OFTEC Technical 
Information Sheet TI/136, Fire protection of oil storage tanks.  
Precautions should also be taken wh en an oil storage tank is located close to a boundary. 
The installation of a tank should not inhibit full development of a neighbouring plot.  
Large tanks -  an oil tank with a capacity of more than 3500 litres should be located in 
accordance with the recomm endations in BS 5410: Part 2: 1978.  
Small tanks -  an oil tank with a capacity of not more than 3500 litres should be located in 
accordance with the following table:

Page 295 Applicable from 5  June 2023   3.23.2  Additional fire  protection 
The fuel feed system from the storage tank to the combustion appliance is also a potential 
hazard in the event of fire. The fire valve on the fuel feed, should be fitted in accordance 
with clause 8.3 of BS 5410: Part 1: 1997 and OFTEC Technical Book 3.  
Oil pipelines located inside a building should be run in copper or steel pipe. The 
recommendations of clause 8.2 of BS 5410: Part 1: 1997 should be followed.  
Fire can also spread to an oil storage tank along the ground. Provision should therefore be 
made to prevent the tank becoming overgrown such as a solid, non- combustible base in 
full contact with the ground. A base of concrete at least 100 mm thick or of paving slabs at 
least 42 mm thick that extends at least 300 mm beyond all sides of the tank would be 
appropriate. However, where the tank is within 1 m of the boundary and not more than   
300 mm from a barrier or a wall of non- combustible construction type 7, short duration (see 
table to Section 2: Fire, annex 2.B.1), the base need only extend as far as the barrier or 
wall. 
3.23.3  Storage within a  building 
Where a storage tank is locate d inside a building, additional safety provisions should be 
made including the following:  
a. the place where the tank is installed should be treated as a place of special fire risk,  
and 
b. the space should be ventilated to the external air, and  
c. the space should have an outward opening door that can be easily opened without a 
key from the side approached by people making their escape, and  
d. there should be sufficient space for access to the tank and its mountings and fittings, 
and 
e. a catchpit as described in the guidance to Standard 3.24.  
Guidance on protection from spillage is provided to Standard 3.24.  
Further guidance may be obtained from OFTEC Technical Book 3 for garage installations.  
3.23.4  Bulk storage of woody biomass  fuel 
By its very nature woody biomass fuel  is highly combustible and precautions need to be 
taken to reduce the possibility of the stored fuel igniting. To ensure maximum energy from 
the fuel, all storage should be designed to be damp free and improve or maintain the 
moisture content of the fuel at time of delivery. To inhibit the spread of fire to their 
contents, bulk storage for wood fuels should be located in accordance with the following 
table:

beyond each side of the container or storage space 
should be non- combust ible, and  
b. a barrier [1]

b. any door to be outward opening providing short fire resistance duration type 6 [2], and  
c. separated from the building with floor constructions 
providing short fire resistance duration, t ype 2 [2], and  
d. external walls constructed that provide short fire 
resistance duration type 7 or type 8 [2] as appropriate.  
 
Additional information:  
1. BARRIER means an imperforate, non- combustible wall or screen at least 300 mm 
higher than and extending 300 mm beyond either end of the container constructed so 
as to prevent the passage of direct radiated heat.  
2. See Section 2, Fire, annex 2.B.1.  
Protection for pellets -  wood pellets can be damaged during delivery thus producing dust 
that can cause an explosion and precautions need to be taken to reduce this risk. Once a 
year any dust that has collected in the store should be removed.  
Storage containers for wood pellets, where they are to be pumped from a transporter to 
the container, should include a protective rubber mat over the wall to reduce the damage 
to the pellets when they hit the wall. Containers should have an outward opening door 
incorporating containment to prevent the pellets escaping when the door is opened.  
Automated supply -  to maintain fire proof storage and prevent back -burning, there should 
be an interruption to the fuel transport system normally by use of a star -feeder or chute for 
the fuel to fall into the boiler. The installation should be in accordance with the safety 
standards described in BS EN 303- 5: 1999.  
Small installations - delivery of woody biomass fuel in bags would only be economical for 
small installations such as the suggestion in the guidance to Standard 6.2 for the use of a 
small woody biomass stove or boiler as sec ondary heating providing 10% of the annual 
heating demand. The woody biomass fuel should be stored separately from the boiler that 
the fuel feeds for fire safety reasons.

Page 297 Applicable from 5  June 2023   3.24 Fuel storage -  containment  
Mandatory Standard  
Standard 3.24  
Every building must  be designed and constructed in such a way that:  
a) an oil storage installation, incorporating oil storage tanks used solely to 
serve a fixed combustion appliance installation providing space heating 
or cooking facilities in a building will: reduce the risk of oil escaping 
from the installation; contain any oil spillage likely to contaminate any 
water supply, ground water, watercourse, drain or sewer; and permit 
any spill to be disposed of safely  
b) the volume of woody biomass fuel storage allows the number  of 
journeys by delivery vehicles to be minimised.  
Limitation:  
This standard does not apply to portable containers.  
 
 
3.24.0  Introduction 
Oil is a common and highly visible form of water pollution. Because of the way it spreads, 
even a small quantity can c ause a lot of harm to the aquatic environment. Oil can pollute 
rivers, lochs, groundwater and coastal waters killing wildlife and removing vital oxygen 
from the water.  
Oil is a 'List I' substance within the meaning of the EC Groundwater Directive (80/68/EE C). 
The UK government is required by this directive to prevent List I substances from entering 
groundwater and to prevent groundwater pollution by List II substances.  
The storage of oil is a controlled activity under the Water Environment (Controlled 
Activ ities)(Scotland) Regulations 2005 and will be deemed to be authorised if it complies 
with The Water Environment (Oil Storage)(Scotland) Regulations 2006. Enforcement is by 
SEPA.  
Explanation of terms - The following terms are included below to provide clari ty to their 
meaning in this Technical Handbook.  
Catchpit - means a pit, without a drain, which is capable of containing 110% of the 
containers storage capacity with base and walls that are impermeable to water and oil.  
Integrally bunded tank -  means a tank  together with a catchpit manufactured as a self - 
contained unit.  
Woody biomass fuel is unlikely to be locally sourced, except for chopped firewood, and 
for large installations is likely to be delivered in bulk. If the storage container is too small, 
the number of journeys by delivery vehicles will make unnecessary use of diesel fuel.  
################# - Page 298 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 298 Applicable from 5  June 2023   Wood chips tend to be used in large boilers supplying heat to district heating systems 
rather than to individual houses. Information on woody biomass fuel can be found on the 
BSD website  under: 'Storage of woody biomass fuel for heating equipment'.  
Conversions - in the case of conversions, as specified in regulation 4, the building as 
converted shall meet the requirement of this standard (regulation 12, schedule 6).  
3.24. 1 Construction of oil storage  tanks  
Fixed oil storage tanks between 90 and 2500 litres and the fuel feed system connecting 
them to a combustion appliance should be strong enough to resist physical damage and 
corrosion so that the risk of oil spillage is minimised. Tanks should be constructed in 
accordance with:  
a. the recommendations of BS 799: Part 5: 1987, for a steel tank, or  
b. the recommendations of OFTEC Technical Standard OFS T200, for a steel tank, with 
or without integral bunding, or  
c. the recommendations of OFTEC Technical Standard OFS T100, for a polyethylene 
tank with or without in tegral bunding, or  
d. a European harmonised product standard and assessed by a notified body.  
3.24. 2 Installation of oil storage  tanks 
Tanks of more than 2500 litres, and their associated pipework must be installed in 
accordance with the requirements of Regulation 6 of The Water Environment (Oil Storage) 
(Scotland) Regulations 2006. Oil storage containers up to 2500 litres serving domestic 
buildings will be deemed to be authorised if they comply with the building regulations.  
Tanks with a capacity of more than 90 litres but not more than 2500 litres and the fuel feed 
system connecting them to a combustion appliance should be installed in accordance with 
the recommendations of BS 5410: Part 1: 1997.  
Reference should be made to the Scottish E xecutive Code of Practice, Underground 
Storage Tanks for Liquid Hydrocarbons (2003/27). This CoP provide guidance on 
underground and partially buried oil storage tanks. The CoP is currently being updated to 
be consistent with The Water Environment (Control led Activities)(Scotland) Regulations 
2005 and will be issued by SEPA. SEPA also provide guidance in PPG 27, (Installation, 
Decommissioning and Removal of Underground Storage Tanks).  
Care should be taken to prevent leakage from pipework. Pipework should be run so as to 
provide the most direct route possible from the tank to the burner. Joints should be kept to 
a minimum and the use of plastic coated malleable copper pipe is recommended. 
Pipework should be installed in accordance with the recommendations in BS 5410: Parts 
1: 1997 and Part 2:1978 and OFTEC Technical Book 3.  
3.24. 3 Secondary  containment  
Externally located, above ground, oil tanks with a capacity of not more than 2500 litres 
serving a domestic building should be provided with a catchpit or be integrally bunded if 
subject to any of the hazards described below:  
a. tank located within 10 m of the water environment (i.e. rivers, lochs, coastal waters)  
################# - Page 299 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 299 Applicable from 5  June 2023   b. tank located where spillage could run into an open drain or to a loose fitting manhole 
cover  
c. tank withi n 50 m of a borehole or spring  
d. tank over ground where conditions are such that oil spillage could run- off into a 
watercourse  
e. tank located in a position where the vent pipe outlet is not visible from the fill point  
f. any other potential hazard individual to t he site. 
OFTEC Technical Book 3 provides a simple and helpful cross check to the above list.  
A catchpit or integrally bunded tank should be provided in accordance with the 
recommendations of OFTEC Standard OFS T100 and OFS T200; and Clause 6.5 of BS 
5410: Part 1: 1997.  
Secondary containment should also be provided where a tank is within a building or wholly 
below ground.  
3.24. 4 Storage containers for solid biomass  fuel 
In order to best exploit the advantages achieved through the use of woody biomass as low 
carbon technology it is recommended that wood fuel storage provision is of a size that will 
ensure bulk deliveries need not be made at intervals of less that 3 months for bulk storage 
and 6 months for small installations.  
Deliveries of wood pellets may be less frequent than deliveries of wood chips because 
pellets can have 3 times the calorific value of dry wood chips. Alternatively, the storage 
volume can be smaller for the same energy capacity.  
The following table provides recommended size of storage for a variety of different 
dwelling types that will permit a large enough volume to be delivered whilst minimising 
vehicle movements. Advice on the sizing of storage for woody biomass fuel for larger 
buildings is provided in the non- domestic Technical Handbook .

Additional information:  
1. The figures in the table relate to deliveries made every 3 months.  
The guidance to Standard 6.2 suggests that to achieve the carbon emissions target, 
designers and developers may use on- site renewable energy technologies to supply up to 
10% of the annual heating demand, rather than adopting slightly more demanding 
insulation standards for walls. A small woody biomass stove or boiler could provide this 
level of heating.  
The following table provides recommended size of storage for secondary heating for a 
variety of dwelling types:

Page 301 Applicable from 5  June 2023   3.25 Solid waste  storage  
Mandatory Standard  
Standard 3.25  
Every building must be designed and constructed in such a way that 
accommodation for solid waste storage is provided which:  
a) permits access for storage and for the removal of its contents  
b) does not threaten the health of people in and around the building, and  
c) does not contaminate any water supply, ground water or surface water.  
Limitation:  
This standard applies only to a dwelling.  
 
 
3.25.0  Introduction 
Scotland produces large quantities of waste - almost 17 million tonnes in 2010. This 
comes from a range of sources with household waste accounting for 2.8 million tonnes. 
The revised EU Waste Framework Directive establishes the legislative framework for 
handling of waste in the European Union. The Directive lays down that Member States 
must have a National Waste Management Plan, or Plans.  
In June 2010 the Scottish Government launched its Zero Waste Plan which set out actions 
to deliver important changes to how Scotland treats and manages waste. The plan 
includes a 70% recycling rate for household and all other waste streams by 2025. The 
Waste (Scotland) Regulations 2012 provide statutory measures to support delivery of the 
zero waste agenda by requiring, amongst other aspects, separate collection and treatment 
of waste.  
The Environmental Protection Act, 1990 gives powers to the waste collection authority to 
stipulate the type and number of containers to be used. The Act also empowers the waste 
collection authority to designate a collection point for removal of the waste and this is 
normally at the curtilage of the dwelling. Under the Zero Waste Plan local authorities are 
required to provide householder s with separate collection services for dry recyclables 
(glass, metals, plastics, paper and card) by the end of 2013 and for food waste by the end 
of 2015.  
Currently local authorities meet their obligations in different ways and designers need to be 
aware of these local initiatives and make suitable provision in their designs.  
Flats and maisonettes generally have communal storage with the associated risks to 
health and the environment.  
Conversions - in the case of conversions, as specified in regulation 4, the building as 
converted shall meet the requirement of this standard (regulation 12, schedule 6).  
 
 
################# - Page 302 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 302 Applicable from 5  June 2023   3.25.1  Solid waste storage  point  
Every flat and maisonette should be provided with a solid, washable hard- standing large 
enough to accommodate a waste cont ainer (or containers) such as a wheeled bin or some 
other container as specified by the waste collection authority. The hard- standing and 
access to the contents of the container should be readily accessible to allow removal.  
3.25.2  Enclosed  storage 
Where enclosures, compounds or storage rooms are provided they should allow space for 
filling and emptying and provide a clear space of at least 150 mm between and around the 
containers. Communal enclosures with a roof that are also accessible to people should be 
at least 2 m high while individual enclosures of wheeled bins only need to be high enough 
to allow the lid to open.  
3.25.3  Solid waste collection point  
The hard- standing may be a collection point designated by the waste collection authority 
where the cont ainer can be removed or emptied. If the hard- standing is not the collection 
point then there should be an accessible route along which the container can be 
transported to the collection point. Over a short distance in an urban area it would be 
reasonable t o use the access to the flat or maisonette. Over longer distances in the 
country, the container could be dropped off at the collection point using a vehicle as is 
normal for farms.  
3.25.4  Provision for washing  down  
Where communal solid waste storage is loc ated within a building, such as where a refuse 
chute is utilised, the storage area should have provision for washing down and draining the 
floor into a wastewater drainage system. Gullies should incorporate a trap that maintains a 
seal even during periods of disuse. Walls and floors should be of an impervious surface 
that can be washed down easily and hygienically. The enclosures should be permanent 
ventilated at the top and bottom of the wall.  
3.25.5  Security against  vermin  
Any enclosure for the storage of waste should be so designed as to prevent access by 
vermin unless the waste is to be stored in secure containers with close fitting lids, such as 
wheeled bins. The enclosure should not permit a sphere of 15 mm diameter to pass 
through at any poi nt.

Page 303 Applicable from 5  June 2023   3.26 Dungsteads and farm effluent  tanks 
Mandatory Standard  
Standard 3.26  
Every building must be designed and constructed in such a way that there will 
not be a threat to the health and safety of people from a dungstead and farm 
effluent tank.  
 
 
3.26.0  Introduction 
Silage effluent is the most prevalent cause of point source water pollution from farms in 
Scotland. A high proportion of serious pollution incidents occur each year through failure to 
contain or dispose of effluent satisfactorily.  
Collection,  storage and disposal of farm effluent and livestock wastes are all stages when 
pollution can occur. These materials are generally classified by type of stock and physical 
form. This may be solid, semi -solid or liquid. Solids are stored in dungsteads that must be 
properly drained and the effluent collected in a tank while liquids are stored in tanks above 
or below ground. The container must be impermeable.  
The guidance to this standard should not be read in isolation. Appropriate sections of other 
legislation, such as the Control of Pollution (Silage, Slurry and Agricultural Fuel Oil) 
(Scotland) Regulations 2003 and The Water Environment (Controlled Activities) (Scotland) 
Regulations 2011, as amended would also normally require to be met. The Scottish 
Enviro nmental Protection Agency is the body responsible for enforcing these 
environmental regulations and further information may be obtained from their website 
www.sepa.org.uk . 
The Code of  Good Practice for the Prevention of Environmental Pollution from Agricultural 
Activity is a practical guide for farmers, growers, contractors and others involved in 
agricultural activities, on whom there is a statutory obligation to avoid causing pollutio n to 
the environment. The Code provides helpful guidance on the planning, design, 
construction, management and land application of slurries and silage effluent that can give 
rise to pollution of water, air or soil environments.  
Explanation of terms  - The f ollowing terms are included to provide clarity to their 
meaning in this Technical Handbook.  
Dungstead means a permanent storage facility for all farmyard manures including solid 
and semi -solid animal excreta. The construction should allow for any liquid to be contained 
within the store or be allowed to seep out for collection in a leak -proof storage tank.  
Farm Effluent Tank means a leak -proof storage facility for liquid animal excreta (slurry), 
dirty water (water contaminated with slurry) and silage effluent that is of a consistency that 
allows it to be pumped or discharged by gravity at any stage of the handling process.  
Conversions - in the case of conversions, as specified in regulation 4, the building as 
converted shall meet the requirement of thi s standard (regulation 12, schedule 6).

Page 304 Applicable from 5  June 2023   3.26.1  Construction of dungsteads and farm effluent tanks  
Every dungstead or farm effluent tank, including a slurry or silage effluent tank should be 
constructed in such a manner so as to prevent the escape of effluent through the structure 
that could cause ground contamination or environmental pollution.  
The construction should also prevent seepage and overflow that might endanger any 
water supply or watercourse.  
3.26.2  Location of dungsteads and farm effluent  tanks 
Every dungstead or farm effluent tank, including a slurry or silage effluent tank should be 
located at a distance from a premises used wholly or partly for the preparation or 
consumption of food so as not to prejudice the health of people in the food prem ises. The 
dungstead or farm effluent tank should be located at least 15m from the food premises.  
3.26.3  Safety of dungsteads and farm effluent  tanks 
Where there is the possibility of injury from falls, a dungstead or farm effluent tank should 
be covered or  fenced to prevent people from falling in. Covers or fencing should be in 
accordance with the relevant recommendations of Section 8 of BS 5502: Part 50: 1993.

Page 305 Applicable from 5  June 2023   3.27 Water  efficiency  
Mandatory Standard  
Standard 3.27  
Every building must be designed and constructed in such a way that sanitary 
facilities with water efficient fittings which are designed for the prevention of 
undue consumption of water are installed.  
Limitation:  
This standard applies only to a dwelling.  
 
 
3.27.0  Introduction 
Using less water  saves energy and reduces Carbon Dioxide (CO 2) emissions. This is 
achieved by reducing the energy that is used in key areas including:  
* treating water to a standard suitable for drinking  
* distribution of water to homes  
* collection and pumping of generated was tewater  
* treatment of the wastewater  generated 
* heating of water for health and hygiene  
Scottish Water estimate that the average consumption of wholesome water per person in 
Scotland is around 150 litres per day. Water consumption has increased over the last  few 
decades and is projected to continue to rise.  Around 30% of the average household's 
heating bills are spent on heating water for sanitary, health or hygiene purposes. Therefore 
the provision of sanitary appliances and fittings that use water more eff iciently can assist in 
the reduction of associated carbon emissions and the home owner's energy costs.  
The Scottish Water Byelaws set requirements which must be adhered to in all properties 
that have a public water supply. They cover the design, installati on and maintenance of 
plumbing systems, water fittings and water -using appliances. Scottish Water now require 
all new industrial or commercial buildings to be metered. Meters may also be installed in 
dwellings if requested.  
Further information on water eff iciency and related carbon emission savings can be found 
on the websites of Scottish Water, Waterwise and the Energy Saving Trust.  
Conversions - in the case of conversions, as specified in regulation 4, the building as 
converted shall meet the requirement of this standard (regulation 12, schedule 6).  
3.27.1  Water  use 
Water is used for various purposes within a dwellings. The national independent 
organisation 'Waterwise' advise that the daily percentage of demand in key use areas of 
the total supplied water for dwellings to be as follows:  
################# - Page 306 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 306 Applicable from 5  June 2023   WC 
Flushing  Baths  
and taps  Laundry Showers  Drinking 
and other  Washing 
up External  
30% 21% 13% 12% 9% 8% 7% 
The actual water used within a dwellings will be influenced by both the behaviour of the 
occupants in how they use the sanitary facilities and associated water fittings and also the 
volume of water discharged from them. Therefore, controlling the volume of water 
discharged from sanitary facilities and fittings should contribute to reducing the use of 
water.  
Efficie ncy measures can be applied to most sanitary facilities with varying degrees of 
benefits. For certain sanitary facilities reducing the water use will be related to its  
function. For example a bath is generally filled to a water level that suits the occupant and 
therefore controlling water flow from taps to that facility would only serve to extend the 
amount of time taken to fill the bath.  
Most WCs produced today are now of the dual flush type which give users the option of a 
reduced flush, generally for liquid waste or a full flush for solid waste. The flush volume will 
generally be achieved through the valve mechanism of the WC cistern.  
To reduce the water flow rates at taps for wash or hand rinse basins (WHBs) options 
include the installation of flow restr ictors, or aerators. These may be fitted in either the 
water supply pipes serving the sanitary facilities or incorporated within the tap 
components.  
3.27.2  Water efficient  fittings  
Water efficient fittings should be provided to all WCs and WHBs within a dw elling.  
Dual flush WC cisterns should have an average flush volume of not more than 4.5 litres.  
Single flush WC cisterns should have a flush volume of not more than 4.5 litres.  
Taps serving wash or hand rinse basins should have a flow rate of not more than 6 litres 
per minute.  
Many bathroom and fittings manufacturers are now using the latest technology to offer 
comprehensive portfolios of water efficient products that deliver satisfactory performance. 
Further guidance and comparison of water efficient appl iances and fittings for the industry 
can be obtained from schemes such as the water efficient product labelling scheme from 
the Bathroom Manufacturers Association.  
When specifying water efficient fittings consideration should be given to the operational 
flow rates that some heating or hot water appliances, such as combination boilers, need to 
activate their water heating function.  
When installing low volume flush WCs, the pipe diameter, discharge and gradient inter - 
relationship of the drainage system is cr itical in order that the new and any existing 
sections of the drain operate as intended.  
Plumbing and associated water installations should be carried out and commissioned by 
persons who possess sufficient technical knowledge, relevant practical skills and 
experience for the nature of the work undertaken.  
An approved Certifier  of Construction,  who has been  assessed  to have the professional  skills  
and relevant  experience,  can certify  compliance of plumbing,  heating  or drainage installations.

Page 307 Applicable from 5  June 2023   3.28 Overheating  risk 
Mandatory Standard  
Standard 3.28  
Every building must be designed and constructed in such a way that the risk to 
the health of the occupants from overheating is reduced.  
Limitation  
This standard applies only to--  
a) a unit of residential accommodation occupied by an individual, or 
individuals, living together as a family or as a single household, and 
b) a shared multi -occupancy residential building  
 
 
3.20.0  Introduction 
Overheating in buildings  has been  highlighted as a key risk for the health and productivity  of 
people and businesses in the UK. Increasing global temperatures and hot weather events 
put buildings  at increasing risk of summertime  overheating  unless  such  risk is assessed  and 
managed. Overheating occurs when the local indoor thermal environment presents 
conditions  in excess of those acceptable for human  thermal  comfort  or conditions  which  may 
adversely affect human  health.  
Whilst overheating risk may generally be considered an issue principally for southern 
regions of the UK, various research studies undertaken in recent years have identified the 
occurrence of overheating in a wide range of new dwelling types in both Scotland and 
northern England.  Whilst  risk can be driven by many  factors  (see below) , the combination of 
better insulated homes with very low fabric infiltration and the certainty of rising average 
temperatures  and warmer  summers  over the coming  decades  will increase  the likelihood  of 
high internal  temperatures.  
Factors which influence overheating risk in buildings  
Extended periods of sunlight and high external air temperatures contribute to overheating. 
There  are numerous  factors  of building  design that influence  the risk of overheating,  such  as 
orientation of the building  and glazed openings,  solar  gain through glazing,  thermal  mass, 
opportunities  for effective  ventilation  and the levels  of insulation  within  the building fabric. 
Occupant behaviour is also a factor that can significantly reduce the occurrence of 
overheating in buildings  such  as use of openable  windows  when the internal  temperature 
increases  and providing shading through  use of internal  blinds  or curtains.  
This standard introduces  a simple  approach  to risk assessment  and mitigation  based upon two 
of these factors - limiting excessive solar gain and provision for removal of heat via purge 
ventilation.  
The risk of overheating may be greater  and opportunities  for mitigating  more  limited  when 
converting an existing  building  to domestic  or residential  use due to limitations  in design 
choices  arising  from the building location,  orientation,  window openings  and fabric.  
################# - Page 308 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 308 Applicable from 5  June 2023   Useful  advice on design approaches  to avoid overheating risk can be found in publications 
such  as 'Overheating in New Homes'  (Good Homes  Alliance,  2019)  and 'Avoiding  Summer 
Overheating' (Passivhaus Trust,  2021).  
Conversions - in the case of conversions, as specified in regulation 4, the building as 
converted shall meet  the requirements  of this standar d in so far as is reasonably  practicable, 
and in no case  be worse  than before the conversion (regulation 12, schedule 6). 
3.28.1  Options  for assessing  and mitigating  overheating  risk. 
A new dwelling  should  be assessed  and measures  put in place to mitigate  the risk of summer  
overheating.  This can be achieved through  adopting one of the following  two methods.  
* A simple  method.  This specifies  measures  to adequately  mitigate  the risk of summer 
overheating (see clause  3.28.2).  This approach sets out provisions  to limit solar  gain 
through  glazing and provide ventilation to assist  in effective  cooling.  
* Dynamic Thermal Analysis modelling. This uses the dwelling's characteristics to 
calculate the risk of overheating,  modelling  the impact  of the build  form and mitigation 
measures  applied (see clause  3.28.3).  Modelling  may be useful  for conversions,  more 
complex  dwellings,  those  where  significant  areas  of glazing  or where solutions  such  as 
effective  use of thermal  mass and night -time cooling  are proposed.  
Action to mitigate overheating risk does have to be balanced with the provision of good 
daylight  levels  within  homes  and opportunities  to maximise  winter  solar  gains  should also be 
considered, which reduce space heating load. Design solutions are available which 
consider both aspects, e.g. through the use of external shading designed for the summer 
sun path.  
3.28.2  Simple  method 
For many new dwellings, overheating risk can be mitigated by two actions: the limiting of 
unwanted  solar  heat gain through glazing on facades  exposed to the summer  sun path;  and 
effective  ventilation  to remove  the build-up of heat.  The following  actions  should be taken.  
Limiting solar gain through glazing 
Assessment should be undertaken on all building elevations which are oriented between 
east (90o),  through  south  (180o)  to west (270o).  Except  for single  aspect  dwellings  or those 
with adjacent  aspect  (with  one or both aspects  oriented outwith  the described  orientation), this 
will require the assessment  of at least  two building  elevations.  
Assessment  is at room  level to provide greater  assurance of thermal  comfort  in individual 
apartments.  Assessment  should  consider  the area of glazing  based  upon the floor area of the 
apartment  containing the glazing.  For this purpose,  the area of glazing  should  be the total 
exposed area of glazing, excluding any opaque elements such as frames or infill panels.  
* If the area of glazing is greater  than 20% of the area of the apartment,  then provide 
shading such  as louvres  or external  shutters;  or revise  the glazing g-value to reduce solar  
gain in proportion to the increase in glazing area above 20%.  
It is proposed  that any mitigation measure should result  in a heat gain limit no greater 
than for an unshaded area of glazing,  20% of the apartment  floor area,  with a g-value  of 
0.6. 
################# - Page 309 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 309 Applicable from 5  June 2023   It is not the intent of this assessment to preclude areas of glazing larger than the stated 
percentage,  simply  to recognise that increased areas  of glazing  on risk facades  should be 
accompanied by mitigating measures. Changes to the specification of glazing should, where  
practicable,  maintain  a high light transmittance  value (0.7 or better  is recommended) to 
minimise  adverse impact  on daylighting.  
Ventilation to assist in cooling  
Assessment  should be undertaken on all dwellings  based upon  the number  of exposed 
facades  and arrangement  of openings  which  provide ventilation  to apartments  or other 
habitable spaces, as  follows.  
Where a building has:  
* two elevations  which  are parallel,  with ventilation openings  distributed  so that neither 
elevation has less than 1/3 of the combined opening  area,  or 
* one elevation with ventilation openings  (single  aspect)  or two adjacent  elevations  with 
ventilation  openings,  where  all elevations  are oriented outwith  east (90o),  through south 
(180o) to west (270o),  
no further action is required to support  ventilation  to assist  in cooling.  This will be addressed 
by provision of purge ventilation openings which provide the level of air change sought under  
standard 3.14 (4 air changes  per hour).  
In all other cases and where a building has only one elevation with ventilation openings 
(single  aspect)  or two adjacent  elevations  with ventila tion openings,  there  is limited  scope for 
cross ventilation  and the minimum  area of ventilation openings  in apartments  should be 
increased  by 50%,  for example from 5% (1/20th, as set out in clause  3.14.3)  to 7.5%  of the 
floor area in each apartment.  
Where  either  mitigation  of heat gain or provision  of passive  ventilation  to assist  in cooling  is 
not considered practicable,  Dynamic  Thermal  Analysis  should be undertaken.  
3.28.3  Dynamic  Thermal  Analysis  modelling  
The option of Dynamic  Thermal  Analysis  modelling  provides  designers  with greater  flexibility 
than the simplified method. It enables consideration of the dwelling location, construction, 
opening areas, orientation and ventilation against a prescribed occupancy scenario. It 
enabl es modelling of passive mitigation measures to a set overheating criterion and will 
assist  in demonstrating compliance  where  the form or arrangement  of elements  in a dwelling 
make  the application  of the simple  method impractical.  
To demonstrate mitigation of overheating risk by dynamic thermal analysis, assessment 
should be in accordance with CIBSE TM59 'Design methodology for the assessment of 
overheating risk in homes'  (2017).  Assessment  should  apply  the modelling  parameters  set out 
below.  Parties  undertaking modelling should be competent  in use of software  tools  and to 
assess overheating  risk following the procedures  given in CIBSE  methodology.  
Assessment Criteria  
The dwelling should meet the compliance criteria set out in CIBSE TM59 (2017) to 
demonstrate that the risk of overheating has been  sufficiently  mitigated,  assessed  for 'Type I' 
occupancy  (see section  4.4 of CIBSE  TM59),  which  assumes  a dwelling  shall meet  the needs 
of vulnerable occupants.  
################# - Page 310 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 310 Applicable from 5  June 2023   The following provisions  for windows  and doors  should  be applied,  in addition  to guidance set  
out in Section  3.3 and 3.7 of CIBSE  TM59:  
* For a room  occupied during  the day (8:00 to 23:00 hours),  windows,  patio and balcony 
doors  should be set to open  and/or  close  using  these  parameters.  
- start opening when the internal  temperature exceeds  22 degC 
- open  to a maximum  angle of 30o when temperature reaches  26 oC. 
- start closing  when the internal  temperature drops below  26 oC 
- be fully closed  when temperature drops below  22 oC. 
* For bedrooms occupied at night -time (23:00 hrs to 08:00 hrs), windows should be 
modelled with restrictors to reflect safety and security concerns, up to a maximum 
opening  angle of 10o. Additionally,  bedroom  windows  should be modelled as being  open 
at night only if the temperature at 23:00 hours is greater than 23 oC. They should then 
be assumed  to remain  open  overnight.  
* Windows  and doors should be modelled as closed  in unoccupied  rooms.  
* External  doors  should  be modelled as closed at all times.  
* Internal  blinds  should not be used  in the building  design to assess  compliance.  
In developments  of multiple  dwellings,  a sample  of risk dwellings  should be selected, following  
the approach  set out in section  3.1 of CIBSE TM59.  
Justification for inclusion of active measures  
When seeking solutions to an identified overheating risk, passive mitigation measures 
should be prioritised. Active measures such as air -conditioning should only be considered 
where it is demonstrated  that all reasonable passive  measures  have first been  applied.  This 
should  include  evidence of the different  combinations  of passive  measures  assessed  in the 
modelling and why they were not sufficient, including modelled results to show due 
consideration of passive  options.  
3.28.4  Practicality  of mitigation  measures  
Where measures  are implemented  to mitigate overheating risk, they should be achievable in 
use. As is the case for provision of ventilation more generally to a building, measures to 
address overheating risk should take account of the environment within which the building 
sits. This is  particularly  relevant  to the use of ventilation  to reduce levels  of overheating.  
Issues arising  from both noise  from the immediate environment  and air pollution should be 
considered. Such matters are usually material considerations in the granting of planning 
permission for development and any proposed mitigation  measures should be compatible 
with issues already  identified at the development  (for example  location  of a facade adjacent to 
a busy  road).  
Similarly, where issues such as security are a concern and it is not considered practical to 
simply open windows to assist in cooling, further assessment of overheating risk or 
alternative  solutions  may need  to be considered.  Where  conflicting  objectives  are identified, 
this may make the case for dynamic thermal analysis more relevant as a means of 
demonstrating  overheating risk is assessed  and managed.  
 
################# - Page 311 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 311 Applicable from 5  June 2023   Similarly  any mitigation  should not require occupants  to circumvent  measures  intended to 
deliver a safe environment  in respect  of issues  such  as the risk of a fall from height  through 
openings or dwelling  security.  
An assessment and statement on how these matters are considered as part of mitigating 
any identified  overheating risk should be provided as part of the building  warrant  application. 
This should reference any relevant conditions set under other permissions and the 
environmental factors considered in determining the approach to ventilation for cooling. A 
summary of such information should be included within written information provided to the 
building occupant.  
3.28.5  Written  Information 
Where the mitigation on summertime overheating is reliant upon the use of building 
elements  or services,  clear  written  instructions  on the actions  needed should be provided and 
made  available  to the occupiers  of the dwelling.  These should:  
* Identify, locate and explain any systems used in the building to mitigate  overheating risk. 
This should include any provisions made to address site-specific and environmental 
constraints.  
* Provide clear  information on intended  use, controls  and how to operate and maintain 
them. Where part of the solution includes active/mechanical systems to mitigate 
overheating,  appliance manuals  should be provided in the written  information.  
For all dwellings,  the Quick  Start  Guide required under  standard 6.8 should also contain  a 
section on 'Staying cool in hot weather', which provides non-technical advice on how to 
keep the dwelling  cool in hot weather.  
Whilst  the use of internal  fittings  such  as blinds  and curtains  is outwith  the scope  of building 
regulations, their role in mitigating heat gain in summer months is recognised and is 
something  that building  occupants  should be made aware  of within  the Guide.

Page 312 Applicable from 5  June 2023   Annex 3A  Domestic Ventilation  Guide  
3.A.0  Purpose  of This Document  
The building  standards  system  in Scotland  is intended to ensure that building  work on both 
new and existing  buildings  is compliant  with the mandatory  functional  standards.  
Compliance with the standards can be met by following the guidance set out within the 
Scottish Building Standards Technical Handbooks. The system also has flexibility, allowing 
compliance to be achieved by solutions  other  than those  outlined in the Technic al Handbook 
guidance.  This Annex  expands  guidance to standard 3.14 for dwellings  and provides  further 
information  on complying with ventilation provision for dwellings.  
The quality  of the air that people  breathe  in their homes  can have a significant  effect on their 
health and wellbeing. Good indoor air quality is therefore important as people spend a 
substantial  amount  of time in their homes.  The air quality  inside  a building  can also have an 
effect on the building  itself,  particularly  when high levels  of humidity  exist.  
This Annex  describes,  in more  detail,  some  of the ventilation  systems that may be used  to 
ventilate new and existing dwellings and outlines the performance requirements and 
practical  installation  guidance to assist  in delivering  an efficient  system  of ventilation.  It also 
highlights  key installation issues that can affect the performance of the systems.  
A key purpose  of this document  is to raise awareness  of requirements  for the commissioning of 
installed ventilation systems prior to operation to meeting building standards. The mandatory  
building  standard  6.7 (commissioning)  for energy  requires  mechanical  ventilation systems to 
be commissioned to achieve both effective operation and optimum energy efficiency. Clause 
3.14.8 references sections 3.A.5 to 3.A.7 of this Annex for guidance on how to ensure  that a 
ventilation  system  is properly  commissioned.  
The information provided within this document only addresses matters relating to the air 
quality inside the dwelling. It is acknowledged that ventilation may fulfil other roles within a 
dwelling,  such  as the permanent  provision of air for combustion  appliances  and as such may 
require to be considered separately.  Additionally,  the components  of a ventilation  system,  if not 
installed correctly, may have a detrimental effect on the ability of elements within the 
dwelling  to satisfy other  building  standards.  An example of this would  be incorrectly 
positioned  fire dampers  in a wall or floor that requires  to be fire resisting.  In these instances, 
the relevant  sections  elsewhere in the Technical  Handbooks  should be consulted.  
The use of this document  does  not remove the need  to obtain  a building  warrant  where  it is 
required by the building regulations. Furthermore, it is quite acceptable to use alternative 
methods of showing that compliance with the building standards has been or will be 
achieved.  
3.A.1  Ventilation  in Buildings  
All buildings  require to be ventilated  so that the air quality  within  the building is not a threat to 
the health of the occupants or the building itself. This is achieved by the process of 
changing  air in an enclosed  space.  A proportion  of the air in the space  should be regularly 
withdrawn and replaced with external air. Dwellings are generally ventilated through a 
combination of both "purpose  provided ventilation"  and "fortuitous  infiltration".  
################# - Page 313 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 313 Applicable from 5  June 2023   Purpose provided ventilation is the controllable air exchange between the inside and outside of 
a dwelling by means of a range of natural ventilating devices including windows and 
background (background) ventilators or mechanical devices such as extract and supply fans.  
Fortuitous  infiltration  is the uncontrollable air exchange  between  the inside and outside of a 
dwelling due to pressure differences caused by wind and temperature variations. The air 
movement  may occur  through a wide range of air leakage  paths  through  imperfections  in the 
building  structure  such  as cracks and gaps  between  building  elements.  
Infiltration Paths  
 1. under floor ventilators  
2. floor to wall junctio ns 
3. through poorly  constructed 
windows/doors  
4. through floor voids into the wall 
cavity  
5. around poorly  fitted 
windows/doors  
6. ceiling to wall junctions  
7. open flues  
8. around services within hollow 
walls  
9. around the loft  hatch  
10. service penetrations through 
ceiling  
11. vents penetrating the ceiling and 
roof 
12. around and through extract  fans 
13. around waste pipes  
 
 
Reducing the amount of fortuitous infiltration that occurs within a dwelling can play a 
significant part in reducing carbon emissions by minimising both the amount of warm air 
leaking  from the dwelling  and the amount  of cold air entering into the dwelling.  However, this 
air movement  has traditionally  contributed to the ventilation  strategy  of dwellings.  Reducing 
the overall fortuitous infiltration rate of a dwelling, for example below 5 m3/h/m2 @ 50 Pa, 
may necessitate the adoption of continuous mechanical extract ventilation to provide 
satisfactory air quality  of the dwelling.  A more  airtight  building  also places  a greater  need for 
"purpose  provided ventilation"  to deliver  satisfactory  air quality  within  a dwelling.  
In order to be satisfied  that a new dwelling  has an infiltration  rate that meets  the energy 
section  of the technical  standards,  whilst  not adversely  affecting  the method of ventilating the 
dwelling, it is now recommended within guidance to standard 6.2 that air tightness testing is 
carried out on each new dwelling. The results from the test will indicate if the dwelling has 
been constructed and perform ing as designed. Further information on the requirements for 
air tightness testing can be found within clause 6.2.5 of the domestic Technical  Handbook.  
Where  air tightness  testing  indicates  that a constructed dwelling  has a level of air infiltration 
leakier or tighter than the design figure, the adequacy of the chosen ventilation strategy 
should  be checked and re-evaluated.  This may mean  additional  works  are required so that 
adequate ventilation will be provided to all parts of the dwelli ng. Further information on 
approaches to take when the designed level of air -tightness is not achieved in the 
completed building  can be found  in section  3.A.3  of this Annex.

Page 314 Applicable from 5  June 2023   Although  the guidance within  this document  is concerned with the ventilation  of dwellings  to 
assist in maintaining the quality of the indoor air, opening doors and windows may also be 
utilised  to cool the dwelling  in the summer.  Standard 3.28 set requirements  for the mitigation 
of such overheating risk. 
3.A.3  Purpose Provided  Ventilation 
Natural Ventilation  
Two natural air movement forces, wind pressure and the stack effect (thermal buoyancy), 
support  the maintenance of air quality  for the occupants  of a dwelling.  The effectiveness  of 
both of these  mechanisms  in ventilating  a dwelling  is variable due to the air movement  being 
influenced by the climatic conditions that occur throughout the year. Additionally, as no 
filtering occurs in natural ventilation, the indoor air quality can only ever be as good as the 
air outside.  
The effectiveness of natural ventilation is very much dependent on the design of the dwelling, 
as well as external factors such as the geometry, orientation and geographic/topographic  
location of the building.  For example,  designing a natural  ventilation system for a single 
aspect dwelling on the leeward side of a building will present a far greater  challenge than 
one for a dual facing  multi -storey  house in an elevated  location.  
The building components that facilitate natural ventilation can include:  
* Windows, doors and rooflights to apartments (livingrooms, bedrooms, etc)  
* Background ventilators to all rooms  
* Passive  stack ventilator  to wet rooms (kitchens,  bathrooms,  etc) 
However, natural ventilation is commonly combined with intermittent mechanical extract.  
Mechanical ventilation  
In a mechanical ventilation system, air movement is generated by a powered fan. The 
effectiveness of a mechanical ventilation system relies on the design, appropriate 
product/component  selection,  installation,  workmanship,  commissioning,  maintenance and the 
awareness of the correct operation of the system by the occupier of the dwelling. In systems 
where air is mechanically introduced into the building, treatment by filters may improve the 
quality of the indoor air. Such filters must be cleaned/replaced at the correct intervals to 
maintain the performance  of the system.  
Mechanical ventilation systems commonly include:  
* Localised intermittent mechanical  extract  ventilation  with natural  supply  (e.g. 
kitchen/bathroom  fans with background ventilator);  
* Continuous  mechanical  extract  ventilation with a natural  ventilation  supply  providing 
"whole house" ventilation;  or 
* Continuous  (balanced)  mechanical  supply  and extract  (with  or without  heat recovery) 
providing "whole house"  ventilation.  
Even  within  dwellings  with mechanical  supply  and extract,  windows  may still be used  at 
certain times,  for example,  purge ventilation  or cooling the building  in summer.  
 
################# - Page 315 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 315 Applicable from 5  June 2023   3.A.4  Ventilation  Design  Pre- and Post -Construction.  
This section  provides  an outline  of the processes  that can be followed  to determine  the 
adequacy  of a ventilation  strategy  adopted  for a new dwelling  in relation  to, initially  the 
designed,  and ultimately  the "as-constructed"  air infiltration  levels.  
As noted in clause 3.14.2, guidance to the standard sets out three forms of supply and 
extract  ventilation,  with provision recommended on the basis  of the design and confirmed 
infiltration  rate for the dwelling  as follows:  
Ventilation type  Suitable for infiltration rate:  
Natural ventilation (with intermittent 
mechanical extract)  >= 5 m3/(h.m2)@50Pa  
Continuous mechanical extract ventilation >= 3 m3/(h.m2)@50Pa  
Continuous mechanical supply & 
extract ventilation  Any 
It is essential that the basic ventilation strategy is determined at early design stage. There 
are three  routes  to follow,  depending on the design  intent  for the fabric  infiltration  level of the 
proposed dwelling The intended design infiltration rate will therefore fall into one of three 
categories:  
* 'very low infiltration' - 3 m3/(h.m2)@50Pa  or tighter,  
* 'low infiltration' - between  3 and 5 m3/(h.m2)@50Pa  and 
* 'higher  infiltration' - 5 m3/(h.m2)@50Pa  or more.  
Once construction of the dwelling is complete, the air -tightness test results (see section 
3.A.2)  should be compared  with the declared design value used to determine  the ventilation 
strategy.  Where the test results  differ  from the design figure,  the following  actions  are likely to 
be needed. Note that the following examples assume that the ventilation solution 
recommended in guidance is applied  based upon  the declared design infiltration  rate. For 
other solutions, seek specialist  advice.  
Note  also that a tested  infiltration  rate poorer  than the declared design intent  or change  of 
ventilation solution  will result  in a need  to demonstrate that the dwelling  still complies  with 
standard 6.1 and the energy  and emissions  targets  set under  that standard.  
Declared  design  infiltration  rate of 3 m3/(h.m2)@50Pa  or below  - 'very low infiltration' - 
Continuous  mechanical  supply & extract  ventilation.  
* If test reports  below  3 m3/(h.m2)@50Pa  - ventilation  solution  remains  appropriate.  
* If test reports  above  3 m3/(h.m2)@50Pa  - ventilation  solution  remains  appropriate but 
seek  advice  from system  designer  to assess impact  on overall  dwelling  ventilation  rate 
due to any increased  infiltration  element.  
Declared  design infiltration  rate of between  3 and 5 m3/(h.m2)@50Pa  or tighter  - 'low 
infiltration' - Continuous mechanical extract  ventilation.  
* If test reports  below  3 m3/(h.m2)@50Pa  - seek  advice from system  designer  to assess 
impact on overall dwelling ventilation rate due to any reduced infiltration element. 
Evidence of adequacy of ventilation based upon the test infiltration value should be 
provided to the verifier.

Airtightness Testing' . 
3.A.5  Natural  Ventilation with Intermittent  Mechanical  Extract  - 
Installation  and Commissioning 
Natural  ventilation  of a dwelling  may be achieved by the operation  of background ventilators 
and intermittent mechanical  extract.  As noted  in clause  3.14.4,  passive  stack ventilation  can 
be considered as an alternative to mechanical ventilation in some cased, subject to 
specialist  advice.  
An intermittent extract  fan is a mechanical  ventilator  that does  not run continuously,  usually 
only running when there is a particular need to remove pollutants or water vapour (e.g. 
during cooking or bathing). Intermittent operation may be under either manual control or 
automatic  control.  Humidistat  control  should be used for areas  that are designated for the 
drying of  washing.  
An installation  consisting  of background ventilators  and intermittent  extract  fans is not 
recommended for a dwelling  with an air-tightness  level tighter  than 5 m3/hr/m2@50Pa.  
To reduce the effect of stratification  and promote air movement,  the location of background 
ventilators  should be carefully  considered.  Although routinely  installed  in window heads  this 
may not be the ideal  location  due to the potential  for curtains,  blinds,  etc. to reduce air flows. 
Factors  such  as the size and shape  of the room  and the availability  of external  walls  should 
be taken into account. For example, rather than one high level background ventilator it is 
often better to provide two smaller ventilators with the same combined equivalent area 
locat ed at high and low levels  on opposite walls.  
Consideration should also be given to the accessibility and usability of ventilators by 
occupants  and their location relative to heating  components,  such  as radiators,  to reduce the 
unwanted effects of draughts from incoming fresh air and to distribute air within the room.  
Where  a background ventilator  is incorporated in an external  wall a proprietary  wind cowl or 
restrictor may be necessary to reduce wind noise and/or draughts and over provision of 
ventilation,  which  may prevent  the occupier  using it.

Page 317 Applicable from 5  June 2023   Installation  
In all cases, the product manufacturer's installation instructions should be followed.  
Performance  criteria  - supply . Supply  of air to the dwelling  is met by background 
ventilators.  Provisions  are set out in clause  3.14.4.  
Performance  criteria  - extract . The provision  of ventilation,  in respect  of intermittent extract 
rates  are set out in clauses 3.14.4.  
Air Flow  within  dwelling . To assist  in good  air transfer  throughout  the dwelling,  provision 
should be made for air transfer  between  rooms  and circulation  space/other  rooms  as noted in 
clause  3.14.2.  
Duct runs. The location of the fan unit should minimise overall duct run length, both from 
the internal  terminals  to the fan unit and from the fan unit to the external  discharge  terminal.  
Where  a duct breaches  a vapour  control  layer,  the continuity  of the layer  should be reinstated.  
Refer to section 3.A.8 for ventilation ductwork.  
Fitting through external wall . Where the fan is installed through a wall:  
* the cored  hole (and duct)  should have a slight  downward  angle  towards  the outside to 
promote condensate drainage and avoid the risk of water  ingress;  
* the duct that connects  the fan outlet  to the terminal  should be at least  the diameter  of the 
fan outlet; and 
* The duct should  be rigid and be sealed to the external  and internal  wall leafs to maintain 
air tightness.  However,  flexible  ducting  may be used where  rigid ducting  is not possible, 
providing delivered ventilation rates are not compromised.  
Fitting  through window . Where a fan is installed  through  a window  the window and glass 
should be assessed for its suitability to incorporate the fan unit. A mounting kit from the 
manufacturer  of the fan unit should be used.  
External discharge terminals - roof and wall mounted. Proprietary terminals should be 
used.  The free area of the terminal  opening  should be a minimum of 90% of the free area of 
the ducting being used. The terminals should prevent rain, birds and large insects from 
entering the system  (however,  fine fly-proof  mesh  should not be fitted).  
The location of the external  discharge  terminal  should  minimise  the potential  for recirculation of 
extract  air through ventilation  air inlets.  
A cored hole (and duct) through the external wall should have a slight downward angle 
towards  the outside  to promote  condensate drainage and avoid the risk of water  ingress.  
To avoid noxious or dangerous gasses from entering the dwelling the external discharge 
terminal  should be located remote from any flue or drainage vent pipe.  Refer to Section  3, 
Environment,  of the Technical  Handbooks  for guidance.  
Controls  - operation.  If control  of the fan speed is undertaken  manually,  the method of 
operating the fan in boost  mode should be made  obvious.  Switching  should be provided locally  
to the spaces being  served,  e.g. bathrooms,  kitchen.  
Controls  - isolation . A local manual  override control  should be provided to an extract  fan 
with automatic control to allow, amongst other things, for maintenance of the unit. This 
manual  override control  should be situated in a location  that will not encourage  its use as an 
"on-off switch" by the  occupants.  
################# - Page 318 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 318 Applicable from 5  June 2023   Controls  - accessibility.  Manual  switching  controls  for the fans should be accessible  and 
positioned at least  350 mm from any internal  corner  (where  practicable)  and between  900 - 
1100 mm above floor level.  
Noise - internal . Extract fans should be capable of passing the required continuous air flow 
rate, at the available  pressure drop,  without  generating  excessive  noise (maximum  of 30 dB 
LAeq.T  to bedrooms  and livingrooms  and 45 dB LAeq.T  to less sensitive  rooms,  such  as kitchens).  
Noise - external . In situations where external noise is likely to be a nuisance to the 
occupants  a sound  attenuator  may be fitted  to the duct.  It should  be noted,  however,  that 
sound attenuators  can reduce the air flow rate and a larger  capacity  fan may be necessary to 
achieve the minimum extraction  rates  needed.  
Commissioning  
Written  information.  A report  containing the information gathered from the commissioning 
and testing  of the ventilation  systems  should be prepared and submitted  to the verifier.  
A copy  of the report,  together  with written  information on the design and use of the system 
should be provided to the owner  (see clause  3.14.8).  
Initial visual inspection . Verify that system is installed in accordance with the design 
criteria;  Refer  to information recorded  during  the construction  process  to confirm  no issues 
identified and unresolved.  
All temporary protection and packaging has been removed from all products.  
All fans and terminals  are in good  condition  with no obvious  defects  that will be hazardous or 
affect the system  performance.  
Functional  checks.  Check  fan operates  correctly  when activated by manual  control  (e.g. 
light switch),  or automatic  control  (e.g. humidistat  activated at greater  than 60% humidity); 
and 
Check  that the fan switches  off after controls  are de-activated and in the case  of run-on 
timers,  that these  continue  to operate for the period  set by the designer.  
Airflow measurement . All intended background ventilators or other air transfer devices 
should be open.  All internal  and external  doors  and windows  should be closed,  including the 
room  in which  measurement  is being  carried  out. 
Airflow measurements  should  be performed  on each  extract  fan using  suitable  equipment, for 
example, a powered hood or a vane anemometer or similar airflow device with proprietary 
hood attachment and results recorded in litres per second (l/s). The airflow device  should be 
capable of achieving an accuracy of +- 5% and have been  calibrated within the  last 12 months 
at a UKAS  accredited calibration centre.  
Reference should be made  to design airflow rates.  These and the measured  airflow for each 
extract  fan should be recorded  on the commissioning  sheet.  
Controls . All local controls should be installed following the manufacturer's instructions 
and clearly labelled, indicating their function.  
Where manual  controls  are provided clear  and detailed written  instructions  shou ld be made 
available to the occupier.  
Where  control  of the fan is automated,  the controls  are configured  to ensure that such 
operation,  e.g. rapid changes  in fan speed,  are not disturbing to occupants.  
################# - Page 319 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 319 Applicable from 5  June 2023   As far as practical,  the correct  operation of each control  function  should be tested  and the 
extent  and result  of this exercise  recorded.  
3.A.6  Continuous  Mechanical  Extract  Ventilation - Installation  and 
Commissioning 
A continuously operating mechanical extract ventilation system comprises of a centrally 
located extract unit with multiple extract points, or separate extract fan units. Both are 
designed to provide whole  dwelling  ventilation  via a continuous  low level extract  rate from 
each moisture producing area within the dwelling. The unit or fans have a manually operated  
or automated (with  humidity  control)  boost  facility.  Replacement  air is provided throughout  the 
dwelling  by infiltration  and background ventilator  provision.  
A continuous  mechanical  extract  ventilation  system  is not recommended for very low 
infiltration dwellings, with a designed or confirmed air -tightness level tighter than 3 
m3/(h.m2)@50Pa.  
To reduce the effect of stratification  and promote air movement,  the location of background 
ventilators  should be carefully  considered.  Although  routinely  installed in window  heads  this 
may not be the ideal location due to the potential  for curtains,  blinds,  etc. to reduce air flows. 
Factors  such  as the size and shape  of the room  and the availability  of external  walls  should be 
taken into account. For example, rather than one high level background ventilator it is often 
better to provide two smaller ventilators with the same combined equivalent area located at 
high and low levels  on opposite walls.  
Consideration should also be given to the accessibility and usability of ventilators by 
occupants  and their location relative to heating components,  such  as radiators,  to reduce the 
unwanted effects of draughts from incoming fresh  air and to distribute air within the room.  
Where  a background ventilator  is incorporated  in an external  wall a proprietary  wind cowl or 
restrictor may be necessary to reduce wind noise and/or draughts and over provision of 
ventilation,  which  may prevent  the occupier  using it. 
Installation  
The product manufacturer's installation instructions should be followed.  
Performance  criteria  - supply . Supply  of air to the dwelling  is met by background 
ventilators.  Provisions  are set out in clause  3.14.5.  
Performance  criteria  - extract.  The provision of ventilation,  in respect  of extract  rates  at 
continuous  and high/boost  level are set out in clauses  3.14.2 & 3.14.5.  
Air flow. To assist in good air transfer throughout the dwelling, provision should be made for 
air transfer  between rooms  and circulation  space/other  rooms  as noted in clause 3.14.2.  
Fan Unit (central) . The fan unit should be:  
* located as specified  by the system  designer.  
* location to minimise  overall  duct run length from the internal  extract  terminals  to the fan 
unit and from the fan unit to the external  discharge terminal.  
* located to allow safe access to undertake routine maintenance of the unit. 
* installed  to allow  sufficient  space  for replacement  at the end of its operational  life of both 
the whole unit or of key mechanical/electrical components. This should be achievable 
################# - Page 320 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 320 Applicable from 5  June 2023   without need to remove fixed structures or remove significant lengths of connected 
ductwork;  
* installed  on a suitable  sound structure,  which  is stable and level;  
* insulated to minimise  the potential  of condensation forming  within  or on the fan unit 
casing.  This is not necessary  if the unit is pre-insulated;  and 
* provided with a condensate drain that terminates in an appropriate location. The 
condensate pipe should be installed to have a minimum 5o fall from the fan unit. The 
drain should be adequately  secured and where passing through  an unheated  space  must 
be insulated to prevent freezing. The rate of condensate forming may be several litres 
per day and therefore the location  of the drain and its final discharge should take account 
of this. Connections  to a waste  pipe or drain should be made  through  a trap. However,  it is 
not recommended that a trap is installed on the condensate pipe as this could be 
subject to drying out. 
* installed  using  the manufacturer's  supplied  or recommended fixing  brackets.  Anti- 
vibration isolation  may be necessary  for the extract  unit and should be located  and 
installed  in accordance  with the manufacturer's  instructions.  
Room  Extract  Terminals  & Grilles . Room  air extract  terminals  should be installed  as 
detailed by the system  designer.  
Room  air extract  terminals  should be positioned  to clear  as much  air from as much  of the room  
as possible  and in a bathroom  or shower  room  ideally  over the bath or shower.  They should be 
installed  at high level and away from internal  doors.  
Where the extract terminals are fixed, there should be a means of achieving effective 
balancing of the system.  If this is not provided within  the fan unit then dampers  should  be 
installed  within  the duct system  to allow balancing when the system  is commissioned.  
If the terminals are adjustable each terminal should be capable of being locked in its 
commissioned  position once system  balance has been  achieved.  It is vital for the correct 
operation of the system  that the system  remains  balanced in its commissioned  state. 
The location  and performance of extract  terminals  should be carefully  considered to ensure 
they do not adversely  affect  the safe operation  of an open- flued appliance,  that is, cause  the 
spillage of combustion products from the appliance. Refer to section 3 of the Domestic 
Building  Standards  Technical  Handbook for guidance  
Fixed  Terminals . If the extract  air terminals  are fixed,  ensure that effective  balancing of the 
system can be achieved. If this is not provided within the fan unit then dampers should be 
installed  within  the duct system  to allow balancing when the system  is commissioned.  
Adjustable Terminals . Ensure each terminal/grille can be locked in its commissioned 
position once system  balance has been  achieved.  It is vital for the correct  operation of the 
system  that the system  remains  balanced in its commissioned  state.  
Duct runs. The location of the fan unit should minimise overall duct run length, both from 
the internal  terminals  to the fan unit and from the fan unit to the external  discharge  terminal.  
Where  a duct breaches  a vapour  control  layer,  the continuity  of the layer  should be reinstated.  
Refer to section 3.A.8 for ventilation ductwork.  
Fitting through external wall . Where the fan is installed through a wall:  
################# - Page 321 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 321 Applicable from 5  June 2023   * the cored  hole (and duct)  should have a slight  downward  angle  towards  the outside to 
promote condensate drainage and avoid the risk of water  ingress;  
* the duct that connects  the fan outlet  to the terminal  should be at least  the diameter  of the 
fan outlet; and 
The duct should  be rigid and be sealed to the external  and internal  wall leafs to maintain air 
tightness. However, flexible ducting, whilst not recommended for central systems, may be 
used for individual fans where rigid ducting  is not practicable,  providing  delivered  ventilation 
rates are not compromised.  
Fitting  through window . Where a single fan is installed  through  a window  the window  and 
glass  should be assessed  for its suitability  to incorporate the fan unit. A mounting kit from the 
manufacturer  of the fan unit should be used.  
External  discharge  terminals  - roof and wall mounted.  Proprietary  terminals  should  be 
used.  The free area of the terminal  opening  should be a minimum of 90% of the free area of 
the ducting being used. The terminals should prevent rain, birds and large insects from 
entering the system  (however,  fine fly-proof  mesh  should not be fitted).  
The location  of the external  discharge  terminal  should  minimise  the potential  for recirculation of 
extract  air through ventilation  air inlets.  
A cored hole (and duct) through the external wall should have a slight downward angle 
towards  the outside  to promote condensate drainage and avoid the risk of water  ingress.  
To avoid noxious or dangerous gasses from entering the dwelling the external discharge 
terminal  should be located remote from any flue or drainage vent pipe.  Refer to Section  3, 
Environment,  of the Technical  Handbooks  for guidance.  
Common ducts -  connection. Where a mechanical ventilation system gathers individual 
extract ducts into a common duct for discharge to an outlet, no connections to the system 
should be made  between  any exhaust  fan and the outlet.  The use of non-return  valves  is not 
recommended.  
Controls  - operation.  If control  of the fan speed is undertaken  manually,  the method of 
operating the fan in boost  mode should be made  obvious.  Switching  should be provided locally  
to the spaces being  served,  e.g. bathrooms,  kitchen.  
Where  sensors are not pre-installed  within  the fan unit, or additional  optional  sensors  can be 
installed,  only the sensors  specified by the manufacturer  of the fan unit should be installed.  
If sensors  are duct mounted,  their location  should be noted and provisions  for access for 
maintenance or replacement  made.  
Controls  - isolation.  Continuous  ventilation  systems should  not allow  the occupier  to turn off 
the fan other than at the local isolator for maintenance. Provision of an on/off function may 
result in the fans being operated intermittently and the required continuous air flow 
ventilation rates not being achieved.  
Controls  - accessibility.  Manual  switching  controls  for the fans should be accessible  and 
positioned at least  350 mm from any internal  corner  (where  practicable)  and between  900 - 
1100 mm above floor level.  
Noise - Internal . Extract fans and extract terminals should be capable of passing the 
required continuous air flow rate, at the available pressure drop, without gener ating 
################# - Page 322 -  ##################

Page 322 Applicable from 5  June 2023   excessive  noise  (maximum  of 30 dB LAeq.T  to bedrooms  and livingrooms  and 45 dB LAeq.T  to less 
sensitive rooms, such as  kitchens).  
Noise - external . In situations where external noise is likely to be a nuisance to the 
occupants  a sound attenuator  may be fitted  to the duct.  It should be noted,  however,  that 
sound attenuators  can reduce the air flow rate and a larger  capacity  fan may be necessary to 
achieve the minimum extraction  rates  needed.  
Commissioning  
Written  information . A report  containing the information gathered from the commissioning 
and testing  of the ventilation  systems  should be prepared and submitted to the verifier.  
A copy  of the report,  together  with written  information on the design and use of the system 
should be provided to the owner  (see clause  3.14.8).  
Initial visual inspection . Verify that system is installed in accordance with the design 
criteria;  Refer  to information recorded  during  the construction  process  to confirm  no issues 
identified and unresolved.  
All temporary protection and packaging has been removed from all products.  
All ductwork  and terminals  are in good  condition  with no obvious  defects  that will be 
hazardous or affect the system  performance.  
On the initial start -up check that air flow direction is correct at each room terminal.  
Check for any abnormal noises on start -up or when the system is running in normal 
background  ventilation mode  or when running  at high rate (some  units  have a start-up 
diagnost ic sequence that runs the fans at maximum  speed before reverting  to normal 
operation  - refer to the manufacturer's  instructions).  
Airflow balancing . The system should be balanced to ensure that the designed air flow 
rates  are achieved at each  room.  As there  are several  methods  of control  that may be used in 
domestic  systems  the system  manufacturer's  instructions  should be followed  to achieve 
balancing.  
If specific  details are not included the following steps should be adopted: Adjustable 
terminals  and a fixed  (stepped)  speed fan: 
* The fan speed should be set to achieve  the desired continuous  flow rate; 
* The index terminal flow rate is set to full open and all other terminals are adjusted to 
achieve the required flows  at each  terminal.  (The index  terminal  can be assumed to be the 
furthest  from the fan unit);  
* If the total flow rate cannot  be achieved  through  all the terminals  then the fan speed 
should be increased;  and 
* If all the terminals  have to be closed  significantly  to achieve the required air flow rate then  
reduce the fan speed  and rebalance the terminals.  
Adjustable terminals and a controllable speed fan:  
* The fan speed should  be set approximately  to achieve the desired  continuous  flow rate; 
* The index  terminal  flow rate should be set with the terminal  fully open and all other 
terminals  are adjusted to achieve the required flows  at each terminal;  and 
################# - Page 323 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 323 Applicable from 5  June 2023   * If the index  terminal  has to be closed  to achieve the required air flow rate, then reduce the  
fan speed and rebalance the terminals;  
Fixed  terminals  with flow adjustment  by duct damper  or similar  device  at the fan unit - as above  
depending  on the type of fan speed  control.  
Adjustable terminals and a fixed volume flow fan:  
* The fan speed should be set to achieve  the desired continuous  flow rate. 
* The index  terminal  flow rate should  be set with the terminal  fully open  and all other 
terminals  are adjusted  to achieve the required flows  at each  terminal.  
* Adjustment  of the terminals  achieves  balancing only;  total flow rate is governed by the fan 
control  setting.  Great  care should be taken not to close  the terminals  too far as the fan unit 
will always  maintain  a constant  volumetric  flow rate; closing  the terminals  will only  require 
the fan to work harder  to achieve a given  air flow rate. 
Fixed terminals with an automatic flow adjustment at the fan unit:  
The fan speed  should be set to achieve the desired continuous  flow rate; and 
The flows  are balanced by automatic  devices  located  within  the fan unit and therefore no 
adjustment can be made.  
Airflow measurement . All intended background ventilators or other air transfer devices 
should be open.  All internal  and external  doors  and windows  should be closed,  including the 
room  in which  measurement  is being carried  out. 
Airflow measurements should be performed on each fan or terminal using suitable 
equipment, for example, a powered hood or a vane anemometer or similar airflow device 
with proprietary hood attachment and results recorded in litres per second (l/s). The airflow 
device  should be capable  of achieving an accuracy of +- 5% and have been  calibrated within 
the last 12 months  at a UKAS accredited calibration centre.  
Reference should be made to design airflow rates. These and the measured airflow for each 
extract  fan should be recorded  on the commissioning  sheet.  Measurements  should be taken at 
both maximum rate and minimum  rate fan speeds  
Controls . All local controls should be installed following the manufacturer's instructions and 
clearly labelled, indicating their function.  
Where manual  controls  are provided clear  and detailed written  instructions  should be made 
available to the occupier.  
Where  control  of the fan is automated,  the controls  are configured  to ensure that such 
operation,  e.g. rapid changes  in fan speed,  are not disturbing to occupants.  
If sensors have been installed separately from the fan unit, ensure installation follows the 
manufacturer's instructions.  
Where control of the fan is automated, the controls should be configured to minimise the 
occurrence of 'hunting'. Hunting is where the fan speed continually increases and 
decreases.  If this does  occur,  the occupants  may seek  to modify  the control  system  or turn it 
off to remove the noise  nuisance.  
As far as practical,  the correct  operation of each control  function  should be tested  and the 
extent  and result  of this exercise  recorded.

Page 324 Applicable from 5  June 2023   3.A.7  Continuously  Operating  Balanced  Supply  and Extract Ventilation  - 
Installation and Commissioning 
A continuously  operating balanced supply  and extract  ventilation  system  consists  of centrally 
ducted supply and extract fans that operate continuously. The extract ducts serve the 
moisture producing  areas  of the dwelling  with the supply  ducts  serving  the habitable rooms. 
Free movement  of air between  these  areas  and rooms  is therefore essential.  
Systems with heat recovery operate by passing the warm extracted air through a heat 
exchanger prior to it being exhausted to external air. The recovered heat is then used to 
preheat  the supply  air before  it is distributed  to the habitable rooms.  It is common  in very low 
infiltration buildings for a balanced supply and extract system to be installed with heat 
recovery as the heat exchanger accounts for a relatively small proportion of the overall 
installation  costs.  A continuously  operating balanced supply  and extract  system  is suitable 
for dwellings  regardless  of the level of air-tightness.  Units  providing heat recovery should be 
fitted  with a summer  bypass  function.  
Continuously  operating balanced supply  and extract  systems (with  or without  heat recovery) 
are recommended for dwellings with very low infiltration, that being with an air -tightness 
level tighter than 3  m3/hr/m2@50Pa.  
Installation  
The product manufacturer's installation instructions should be followed.  
Performance  criteria  - supply . Supply  of air to the dwelling  is met by continuous 
mechanical  supply.  Provisions  are set out in clause  3.14.2  & 3.14.6.  
Performance  criteria  - extract . The provision  of ventilation,  in respect  of extract  rates  at 
continuous  and high/boost  level are set out in clauses  3.14.2 & 3.14.6.  
Air flow. To assist in good air transfer throughout the dwelling, provision should be made for 
air transfer  between rooms  and circulation  space/other  rooms  as noted  in clause 3.14.2.  
Fan Unit (central). The fan unit should be:  
* located as specified  by the system  designer.  
* location to minimise  overall  duct run length from the internal  supply  and extract  terminals 
to the fan unit, from the fan unit to the external  discharge terminal  and from the external 
supply  terminal  to the fan unit; 
* located to allow safe and easy  access  to undertake routine maintenance of the unit, 
including  periodic  changing or cleaning  filters  by occupants;  
* installed  to allow  sufficient  space  for replacement  at the end of its operational  life of both 
the whole unit or of key mechanical/electrical components. This should be achievable 
without  the need  to remove  fixed  structures  or remove  significant  lengths  of connected 
ductwork;  
* installed  on a suitable  sound structure,  which  is stable and level;  
* insulated to minimise  the potential  of condensation forming within,  or on, the fan unit 
casing.  This is not necessary if the unit is pre-insulated;  
* provided with a condensate drain that terminates in an appropriate location. The 
condensate pipe should be installed to have a minimum 5o fall from the fan unit. The

Page 325 Applicable from 5  June 2023   drain should be adequately  secured and where passing through  an unheated  space  must 
be insulated to prevent freezing. The rate of condensate forming may be several litres 
per day and therefore the location  of the drain and its final discharge should take account 
of this. Connections  to a waste  pipe or drain should be made through  a trap; however,  it is 
not recommended that a trap is installed on the condensate pipe as this could be 
subject to drying out. 
* installed  using the manufacturer's  supplied or recommended fixing  brackets.  Anti- 
vibration  isolation  may be necessary  for the extract  unit and should be located and 
installed  in accordance  with the manufacturer's  instructions.  
Room  Extract  Terminals  & Grills . Room  air supply  and extract  terminals  should be installed  
as detailed by the system  designer;  
Room  supply  terminals  should be installed  at high level,  away  from internal  doors  and directed 
across an area of unobstructed ceiling  to provide good mixing  without  causing draughts.  
Room  extract  terminals  should be positioned  to clear  as much  air from as much  of the room as 
is practical  and in a bathroom  or shower  room  should ideally  be positioned  over the bath or  
shower.  They should be installed  at high level and away  from internal  doors.  
In open plan areas where both supply and extract terminals may be installed, for example 
kitchen/dining rooms, consideration should be given to the proximity of the terminals to 
avoid short  circuiting  of the air. That is, to avoid the replacement  air being extracted  before it 
has mixed  with or displaced  stale air. 
The number and location of terminals installed in a ventilated space should allow effective 
air distribution and minimise  air noise when the system  is operating  at boosted  air flow rates.  
The location  and performance of extract  terminals  should be carefully  considered to ensure 
that they will not adversely affect the safe operation of an open flued appliance, that is, 
cause the spillage of combustion products for the appliance. Refer to Section 3 of the 
Technical Handbooks for guidance.  
Fixed Terminals . If the supply and extract air terminals are fixed, ensure that effective 
balancing of the system can be achieved. If this is not provided within the fan unit then 
dampers  should be installed  within  the duct system  to allow balancing when the system  is 
commissioned  
Adjustable Terminals . Ensure each terminal/grille can be locked in its commissioned 
position once system  balance has been  achieved.  It is vital for the correct  operation of the 
system  that the system  remains  balanced in its commissioned  state.  
Duct runs. The location of the fan unit should minimise overall duct run length, both from 
the internal  terminals  to the fan unit and from the fan unit to the external  discharge  terminal.  
Where  a duct breaches  a vapour  control  layer,  the continuity  of the layer  should  be reinstated.  
Refer to section 3.A.8 for ventilation ductwork.  
Common ducts -  connection. Where a mechanical ventilation system gathers individual 
extract ducts into a common duct for discharge to an outlet, no connections to the system 
should be made  between  any exhaust  fan and the outlet.  The use of non-return valves  is not 
recommended.  
Fitting through external wall . Where a duct is installed through a wall:

Page 326 Applicable from 5  June 2023   * the cored  hole (and duct)  should have a slight  downward  angle  towards  the outside to 
prom ote condensate drainage and avoid the risk of water  ingress;  
* the duct that connects  the outlet  to the terminal  should be at least  the diameter  of the 
terminal;  and 
* The duct should  be rigid and be sealed to the external  and internal  wall leafs to maintain 
air tightness.  
Flexible  ducting is not recommended for central  systems except  where rigid ducting is not 
practicable,  providing  delivered ventilation  rates  are not compromised.  
External discharge terminals - roof and wall mounted. Proprietary terminals should be 
used.  The free area of the terminal  opening  should be a minimum of 90% of the free area of 
the ducting being used. The terminals should prevent rain, birds and large insects from 
entering the system  (however,  fine fly-proof  mesh  should not be fitted).  
The location  of the external  discharge  terminal  should  minimise  the potential  for recirculation of 
extract  air through ventilation  air inlets.  
A cored hole (and duct) through the external wall should have a slight downward angle

To avoid noxious or dangerous gasses from entering the dwelling the external discharge 
terminal  should be located remote from any flue or drainage vent pipe.  Refer to Section  3, 
Environment,  of the Technical  Handbooks  for guidance.  
Controls  - operation.  If control  of the fan speed is undertaken manually,  the method of 
operating the fan in boost  mode should be made  obvious.  Switching  should be provided locally  
to the spaces being served,  e.g. bathrooms,  kitchen.  
A remote  fault/status  indicator  should be provided in a circulation  area,  such  as a hallway,  to 
alert occupiers  if the system  is not functioning  correctly.  
Where  sensors are not pre-installed  within  the fan unit, or additional  optional  sensors  can be 
installed,  only the sensors  specified by the manufacturer  of the fan unit should  be installed.  
If sensors  are duct mounted,  their location  should be noted and provisions  for access for 
maintenance or replacement  made.  
Controls  - isolation.  Continuous  ventilation  systems should not allow  the occupier  to turn off 
the fan other than at the local isolator for maintenance. Provision of an on/off function may 
result in the fans being operated intermittently and the required continuous air flow 
ventilation rates not being achieved  
Controls  - accessibility.  Manual  switching  controls  for the fans should be accessible  and 
positioned at least 350 mm from any internal corner and between 900 - 1100 mm above 
floor level.  
Noise - Internal . Fan unit, air supply  and extract  terminals  should be capable of passing the 
required continuous air flow rate, at the available pressure drop, without generating 
excessive  noise  (maximum  of 30 dB LAeq.T  to bedrooms  and livingrooms  and 45 dB LAeq.T  to less 
sensitive rooms, such as  kitchens).  
Noise - external . In situations where external noise is likely to be a nuisance to the 
occupants  a sound attenuator  may be fitted  to the duct.  It should be noted,  however,  that 
sound attenuators  can reduce the air flow rate and a larger  capacity  fan may be necessary to 
achieve the minimum extraction  rates  needed

Page 327 Applicable from 5  June 2023   Commissioning  
Written  information.  A report  containing the information gathered from the commissioning 
and testing  of the ventilation systems should be prepared and submitted  to the verifier.  
A copy  of the report,  together  with written  information on the design and use of the system 
should be provided to the owner  (see clause  3.14.8).  
Initial visual inspection . Verify that system is installed in accordance with the design 
criteria;  Refer  to information recorded  during  the construction  process  to confirm  no issues 
identified and unresolved.  
All temporary protection and packaging has been removed from all products.  
All ductwork  and terminals  are in good  condition  with no obvious  defects  that will be 
hazardous or affect the system  performance.  
On the initial start -up check that air flow direction i s correct at each room terminal.  
Check for any abnormal noises on start -up or when the system is running in normal 
background  ventilation mode  or when running  at high rate (some  units  have a start-up 
diagnostic  sequence that runs the fans at maximum  speed  before reverting  to normal 
operation  - refer to the manufacturer's instructions).  
Airflow balancing . The system should be balanced to ensure that the designed air flow 
rates  are achieved at each  room.  As there  are several  methods  of control  that may be used in 
domestic  systems  the system  manufacturer's  instructions  should be followed  to achieve 
balancing.  
If specific  details  are not included  the following  steps  should be adopted: Adjustable terminals  
and a fixed  (stepped)  speed fan: 
* the fan speed should be set to achieve the desired continuous  flow rate; 
* the index terminal flow rate is set to full open and all other terminals are adjusted to 
achieve the required flows  at each  terminal.  (The index  terminal  can be assumed to be the 
furthest  from the fan unit);  
* if the total flow rate cannot  be achieved  through  all the terminals  then the fan speed 
should be increased;  and 
* if all the terminals  have to be closed  significantly  to achieve  the required air flow rate then  
reduce the fan speed  and rebalance the terminals.  
Adjustable terminals and a controllable speed fan:  
* the fan speed should  be set approximately  to achieve the desired continuous  flow rate; 
* the index  terminal  flow rate should be set with the terminal  fully open and all other 
terminals  are adjusted to achieve the required flows  at each terminal;  and 
* if the index  terminal  has to be closed  to achieve the required air flow rate, then reduce the 
fan speed and rebalance the terminals;  
Fixed  terminals  with flow adjustment  by duct damper  or similar  device  at the fan unit - as above  
depending  on the type of fan speed  control.  
Adjustable terminals and a fixed volume flow fan:  
* The fan speed should be set to achieve  the desired continuous  flow rate. 
################# - Page 328 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 328 Applicable from 5  June 2023   * The index  terminal  flow rate should be set with the terminal  fully open  and all other 
terminals  are adjusted  to achieve the required flows  at each  terminal.  
* Adjustment  of the terminals  achieves  balancing only;  total flow rate is governed by the fan 
control  setting.  Great  care should be taken not to close  the terminals  too far as the fan unit 
will always  maintain  a constant  volumetric  flow rate; closing  the terminals  will only  require 
the fan to work harder  to achieve a given  air flow rate. 
Fixed terminals with an automatic flow adjustment at the fan unit:  
* The fan speed should be set to achieve the desired continuous  flow rate; and 
* The flows  are balanced by automatic  devices  located within  the fan unit and therefore no 
adjustment can be made.  
Airflow measurement . All internal and external doors and windows should be closed, 
including the room in which measurement is being carried out.  
Airflow measurements  should be performed in each  terminal  using  suitable equipment,  for 
example, a powered hood or a vane anemometer or similar airflow device with proprietary 
hood  attachment  and results  recorded  in litres per second  (l/s). The airflow device  should be 
capable of achieving an accuracy of +- 5% and have been calibrated within the last 12 
months  at a UKAS accredited calibration centre.  
Reference should be made to design airflow rates. These and the measured airflow for each 
extract  fan should be recorded  on the commissioning  sheet.  Measurements  should be taken  at 
both maximum rate and minimum  rate fan speeds.  
Controls . All local controls should be installed following the manufacturer's instructions and 
clearly labelled, indicating their function.  
Where manual  controls  are provided clear  and detailed written  instructions  should be made 
available to the occupier.  
Where  control  of the fan is automated,  the controls  are configured  to ensure that such 
operation,  e.g. rapid changes  in fan speed,  are not disturbing to occupants.  
If sensors have been installed separately from the fan unit, ensure installation follows the 
manufacturer's instructions.  
Where control of the fan is automated, the controls should be configured to minimise the 
occurrence of 'hunting'. Hunting is where the fan speed continually increases and 
decreases.  If this does  occur,  the occupants  may seek  to modify  the control  system  or turn it 
off to remove the noise  nuisance.  
As far as practical,  the correct  operation of each control  function  should be tested  and the 
extent  and result  of this exercise  recorded.  
3.A.8  Ventilation  Ductwork  
General Recommendations 
Ducting should be:  
* sized  to minimise  pressure loss and noise generation.  This is achieved by sizing  of the 
ducts  and terminals  to limit the air velocity.  The main  ducts  should be the same  size as the 
fan unit spigot;  and 
################# - Page 329 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 329 Applicable from 5  June 2023   * routed in a manner which minimises overall duct length and the number of bends 
required.  It is particularly  important  to minimise  bends  in main  ducts  operating  at higher air 
velocities.  
* installed  where it cannot  be easily  damaged  e.g. not across  open  loft areas  where it may 
be stood on; 
* installed  to allow sufficient  space  to allow access for cleaning  ducts  where  room  extract 
terminal/grilles are not fitted  with filters;  
* insulated where it is passes through unheated areas with the equivalent of at least 25 
mm of a material  with a thermal  conductivity  of not more  than 0.04 W/mK.  This reduces 
the risk of condensation occurring  within  the duct; 
* insulated or be fitted  with a condensate trap where  a duct extends  above  roof level.  The 
condensate trap should be fitted  just below  roof level;  
* insulated where carrying  cold air between  the external  supply/discharge terminal(s)  and a 
fan unit sited  within  the heated  envelope.  A vapour barrier should be wrapped  outside the 
insulation to prevent condensation occurring within the insulation material, alternatively,  
rigid insulation of a type that is unaffected by moisture  may be used;  
* fitted with a condensate trap where it is installed vertically. The trap should prevent 
condensation flowing  down  the duct and potentially  damaging  a mechanical  extract  fan; 
* arranged to slope slightly  downwards  away  from the fan unit, to prevent  backflow  of any 
moisture into the unit, when installed  horizontally;  
Flexible ducting  
Rigid ducts should be used wherever possible. Where flexible ductwork is installed this 
should only be used  for final connections  and duct lengths  should be kept to a minimum.  All 
flexible  ductwork  should meet the standards  of BSRIA BG 43/2013.  
Flexible  ducting is generally  only suitable  for single  extract  fan installations;  refer to extract fan 
manufacturer's  instructions.   
Ducting  should be pulled  taut to ensure that the full internal  diameter  is obtained and flow 
resistance  minimised.  This is considered to have been achieved  if the duct is extended to 90% 
of its maximum length  
Flexible ducting should be supported at suitable intervals to minimise sagging. Refer to 
manufacturer's  information but generally  it should be supported at no greater  than 600 mm 
intervals.  
Bends  in ducts  should have a minimum  inside  radius  equal  to the diameter  of the duct.  If 
tighter  bends are required,  rigid bends should be used.  
Perforated insulated  flexi duct,  used  to minimise  airborne sound transmission,  should not be 
used between the fan unit and the external discharge terminal to prevent condensation 
occurring within  the insulation  material.

Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 330 Applicable from 5  June 2023   Note: Insulation omitted to ceiling and over duct to aid clarity of duct arrangement.  
Duct Connections/Terminals  
All duct connections  require to be sealed.  Where  ducts  are installed  against  a solid structure 
this can sometimes  be difficult  to achieve.  In such  locations  pre-assembly  of duct sections 
should be considered. This will require connections to be permanent to ensure the seal is 
maintained during  installation.  
Connection of lengths  of flexible  duct must  use a rigid connector  and jubilee  clips or similar to 
ensure  a long term seal is achieved.  Connections  of lengths  of flexible  duct should not be 
taped only. 
Where access to ducts will not be possible after construction is complete, e.g. ductwork 
within floor and wall voids, consideration should be given to permanent connection and 
sealing with an appropriate non-hardening sealant.  Using  duct tape to achieve connections 
and seals  is not recommended in these situations.  
Connection of components  should not result  in significant  air flow resistance.  Components 
should be proprietary  and fit easily  together  without  distortion.

Page 331 Applicable from 5  June 2023   Each  air terminal  should have a free area of at least  90% of the free area of its associated 
duct.  
Where a duct breaches  a vapour  control  layer  the continuity  of the layer  should  be reinstated  
after installation,  for example,  with suitable tapes  or preformed sleeves.  
Where  an extract  duct is installed  this should not adversely  affect the sound insulation  of a 
separating wall or floor, internal  wall or intermediate floor refer to Section 5, Noise,  of the 
Domestic  Building Standards  Technical  Handbook  for guidance.  
Where an extract  duct penetrates  cavity  barriers  or floors,  ceilings  and walls  that require a fire 
resistance refer to Section 2, Fire, of the Domestic Building Standards Technical Handbook 
for guidance.  
3.A.9  Carbon  Dioxide  Monitoring Equipment  
This guidance supplements information provided under clause 3.14.7.  
Air within a dwelling can contain an array of both naturally occurring and synthetic 
contaminants, particulates and gases. The majority of these contaminants are not easily 
identifiable  to the occupants,  even at relatively  high levels.  Research carried  out recently  for 
the Building  Standards  Division  (available here)  indicated that over 90% of occupiers  believe 
the indoor air quality within their main bedrooms is very good or fairly good. However, on- 
site monitoring of carbon dioxide  (CO 2) levels  found  that 83% of properties  tested  had time 
weighted concentrations greater than 1,000 parts per million (ppm) within the main 
bedrooms.  
Although in terms  of health and safety,  exposure to CO 2 levels  of up to 5,000 ppm over an 8 
hour period is generally  not considered a risk1, levels  of over 1,000 ppm can be taken as an 
indicator  of poor ventilation rates.  High levels  of CO 2 will, therefore,  be associated  with the 
presence of higher levels of other contaminants, such as volatile organic compounds, 
formaldehyde, particulates, bacteria, etc. The levels of these other contaminants are less 
easy  to identify  accurately  without  very sensitive  testing  equipment.  
As dwellings become more air -tight the levels of uncontrolled "background ventilation" 
decreases. This results in a greater reliance on occupant interaction with controllable 
ventilators, such as windows and background ventilators, to maintain satisfactory levels of 
indoor ai r quality. However, as indicated above, occupants are frequently not aware of the 
need to ventilate. Therefore, to raise occupant awareness of poor ventilation, as evidenced 
by high levels of CO 2, the guidance to building standard 3.14 calls for a CO 2 moni tor to be 
installed in the main or principal bedroom in a dwelling constructed to a level of air -
tightness lower than 15 m3/hr/m2 at 50Pa. Dwellings with levels of air -tightness leakier 
than 15 m3/hr/m2 at 50Pa will have more uncontrolled ventilation, however, current 
building practices should be considered, as the completed building may be inadvertently 
constructed tighter than designed.  
The main  or principal  bedroom  was determined to be the best location  for the CO 2 detection 
equipment  as this is likely  to be the room  most  frequently  occupied for long periods  of time. In 
addition, it is unlikely that the ventilation of the room will change during the period of 
occupation.  That is to say, if windows,  background  ventilators  or doors  are closed  when the 
residents  go to bed it is unlikely  that they will be opened before they rise the next day. It is 
reasonable to assume that if there are high levels of CO 2 indicated in the monitored 
 
1 1 HSE Publication EH40/2005 Workplace exposure limits -  8 hour time weighted average

Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 332 Applicable from 5  June 2023   bedroom,  levels  elsewhere in the property  will also be high.  The ventilation  strategy  adopted to 
reduce CO 2 should,  therefore  be replicated  in other  occupied rooms  in the home.  
It is not intended that the CO 2 monitoring equipment sounds an alarm if the concentration 
levels  exceed 1,000  ppm as it is considered that this could lead to the permanent  disabling of 
the monitor.  Rather,  it is intended  that occupants  can interrogate the equipment  the next day 
and make  informed decisions  on how to ventilate  their home.  The Technical  Handbook 
guidance also calls for information on the ventilation strategy and CO 2 monitoring to be 
provided to the householder. This information is expected to cover the operation of the 
specific  CO 2 monitor  installed  (i.e. not generic  guidance),  an explanation of what the results 
the equipment is giving mean and suggested remedial action that can be taken to reduce 
subsequent overnight CO 2 levels.  
The guidance allows  the CO 2 monitoring  equipment  to be either  a single  unit with detector 
head  and screen  or separate  detector  and screen.  In the case  of a single  unit this would  be 
sited  within  the main  or principal  bedroom  where the screen  can be easily  read.  Where the 
detector  is separate from the screen  the detector  should be sited  in the main  or principal 
bedroom  but the monitor  may be sited  elsewhere,  for example,  in a hallway.  The benefit  of 
separate units  is that additional  detectors,  sited  in other  rooms  may be connected to the 
monitor for additional  coverage.  
A CO 2 monitor  should be permanently  fixed  and is required to be mains  operated.  It should be 
capable of recording  and displaying readings  within  a range of at least  0 - 5,000 parts per 
million  CO 2 and logging  and displaying  data at no more  than 15 minute  intervals  for at least  a 
24 hour period.  A CO 2 monitor  should  be capable  of measuring the actual  level of carbon 
dioxide  present  in the room  they are located  in. Monitors  that give an "equivalent"  or "EQ" 
concentration of CO 2 are not suitable  as they are not sensitive  to CO 2 but are mixed gas 
sensors.  
To allow free air movement  over the detector  head  a CO 2 detector  head  should not be sited 
where air flow may be restricted. For example, close to corners of walls or ceiling/wall 
junctions, where curtains may be expected to be fitted. The average person exhales 
approximately  45,000  parts  per million  of CO 2 in every  breath.  Therefore to prevent  potential 
false  readings  from exhaled breath  the detector  head should be sited  away  from where  the 
head  of the bed would  be expected  to be located.  
When  monitoring concentration levels  of CO 2 within  dwellings  it should be remembered  that 
CO 2 is present  in outside air at concentration levels  of between  350 and 575 ppm.  As all the 
ventilation strategies within the Technical Handbooks rely on an exchange of air from outside 
the in-door concentration levels  of CO 2 will be more  or less the same  as the external air in the 
proximity of the property. Although most whole house ventilation systems include some  form 
of filtration  on the incoming  air ducts,  even they do not prevent  CO 2 entering the building.  
The guidance in the Domestic  Technical  Handbook  calls for occupiers  of newly  constructed 
dwellings  to be provided with guidance on the operation of CO 2 monitoring equipment  and 
their options  for improving ventilation  when indicated  as necessary by the monitor.  
Written information to be passed to the dwelling occupant should include:  
a. The purpose  of the carbon dioxide  monitoring  equipment  is to inform  occupants  of CO 2 
levels  within  their dwelling  over the preceding 24 hour period.  This information can then be  
used by the occupants  to determine the quality  of air within  their homes  and whether 
additional ventilation is required, for example, opening or increasing the opening of 
################# - Page 333 -  ##################

Page 333 Applicable from 5  June 2023   background ventilators.  This section  should advise  that CO 2 is always  present  in the air 
we breathe at levels of around 400 ppm and that levels of CO 2 of up to 5,000 ppm are 
generally  not considered to be a risk. However,  concentration levels  greater  than 1,000 
ppm can be indicative of poor ventilation and consequently, high levels of other 
contaminants.  
b. Specific  details  of the CO 2 monitoring equipment,  including  manufacturer's  operating  
instructions.  Instructions  on operation (manufacturer's  or otherwise)  should include:  
* The location of the CO 2 sensor(s)  and monitor  
* Initial set up procedure  
* How to switch  between  available  modes,  where available  
* How to de-activate  the audible  alarm,  where  fitted  
* How to adjust  the time between  data logging  events,  this should be set at a maximum  
of 15 minute intervals  
* How to interrogate the monitor  to determine CO 2 levels  over the preceding 24 hour 
period  
* Details  and timeframe  for re-calibrating the detector  
* Advice  on location  of furniture near the detector  head  that may affect the operation of 
the unit, in particular  the bedhead  
c. Details  of the ventilation  strategy  adopted in the dwelling,  including  but not limited  to: 
* Window  operation,  including  where  possible  means  of securing  windows  in a partially  
open  position  to prevent unauthorised entry  
* Background  ventilation  location and operation 
* Mechanical  ventilation  - intermittent  operation  
* Mechanical  ventilation - continuous  operation 
d. Information  on how occupants  should ventilate their dwellings  where the CO 2 monitor  
indicates concentration levels in excess of 1,000 ppm for periods of more than one hour.  
This information may be best presented in stages,  for example:  
* 800 - 999 ppm 
* 1,000 - 1,199 ppm 
* 1,200 - 1,499 ppm 
* 1,500 - 1,999 ppm 
* Over 2,000 ppm 
Section 3.A.10 provides a template containing information that should be provided to 
occupiers of new dwellings. The text and layout within the template is intended only as a 
guide and should be taken as being  indicative  of the type of information to be provided.  The 
generic information relating to the CO 2 monitor and ventilation options, that is, windows, 
background ventilators and mechanical extract fans (location and operation) should be 
replaced with building  specific  information.

About your new home  
Your new home is designed and constructed so there are few leaks or draughts. However, it is 
important to ventilate it adequately to help maintain a healthy indoor environment for you and 
your family. As well as minor irritations, for example, a dry throat or headache, poor indoor air 
quality can also make existing conditions, such as asthma, worse. Extreme cases of poor 
indoor air quality may also be a causal factor of other respiratory and health conditions.  
It is sometimes difficult to identify when ventilation is required as it is not easy to tell when the 
quality of the air in your home is poor. To assist you in determining the quality of the air i n your 
home it is fitted with a carbon dioxide (CO 2) monitor. The level of CO 2 present in your home is a 
good indicator of the overall quality of the air. The CO 2 monitor requires free air movement around 
it, therefore, do not place furniture or other objects in front of it that may impede its operation.  
This document provides you with information on the ventilation provisions within your home 
and, together with data from the CO 2 detector, how you should ventilate to maintain a healthy 
environment.  
Providin g adequate ventilation will also reduce the levels of humidity within your home and 
therefore reduce the possibility of condensation forming.

Model Number: 12345  
Frequency of re -calibration: self-calibrating  
Frequency of sensor replacement : 10 years  
Location: The CO 2 monitor is located in bedroom 1 (the master bedroom)  
How to use the CO 2 monitor  
The manufacturer's literature accompanying this document will provide detailed advice on how to 
set up and operate the monitor.  
The CO 2 monitor will provide data on the levels of CO 2 within at least the previous 24 hours. This 
information will enable you to determine whether any action needs to be taken to improve the 
quality of the air in your home. The table below provides guidance on what action should be 
considered for various concentrati on levels.  
It is advisable to initially check the data daily and take whatever action is necessary to improve 
the indoor air quality in your home. Once the air quality has reached an acceptable level the 
frequency of the checks can be reduced. It should be remembered that air quality levels can vary 
due to many factors, so regular readings should be taken to make sure that it is still satisfactory.  
The CO 2 detector head is self -calibrating, the manufacturer's information on recalibration of the 
device should be consulted.  
Note: CO 2 is present in internal and external air at concentration levels of around 400 parts 
per million (ppm). Levels of CO 2 of up to 5,000 ppm are not in themselves a danger to 
healthy occupants but can be indicative of the presence of high levels of other 
contaminants that may cause short or more long- term health issues.  
Action necessary to improve air quality  
Your home has openable windows and controllable background ventilators to allow you to 
adjust the fresh air entering each room. Background ventilators are adjustable and positioned to 
encourage ventilation through each of the rooms. In rooms with more than one background 
ventilator, all ventilators should be opened similar amounts to encourage through ventilation.  
CO2 level  Action  
0 - 349 ppm  Check monitor is working correctly and recalibrate or replace sensor 
head if necessary  
350 - 799 ppm  None 
800 - 999 ppm  No immediate action but maintain daily monitoring  
1,000 - 1,199 ppm  Partially open background ventilators or leave room door partially open  
1,200 - 1,499 ppm  Fully open background ventilators or leave room door partially open  
1,500 - 1,999 ppm  Partially open window  
Over 2,000 ppm  Open window further and leave room door partially open  
To achieve good air quality throughout your home, the ventilation actions identified above 
should be replicated in all occupied apartments in the dwelling.

Page 338 Applicable from 5  June 2023   Section 4 -  Safety 
4.0 Introduction  
4.0.1  Background 
Safety has been defined by the International Standards Organisation as 'a state of freedom 
from unacceptable risks of personal harm'. This recognises that no activity is absolutely 
safe or free from risk. No buildin g can be absolutely safe and some risk of harm to users 
may exist in every building. Building standards seek to limit risk to an acceptable level by 
identifying hazards in and around buildings that can be addressed through the Building 
(Scotland) Regulations.  
Deaths and serious injury to people in and around buildings occur in significant numbers 
from accidents involving falls, collisions, entrapment, scalding, electrocution or malfunction 
of fittings. Designers need to consider all aspects of design carefully to minimise risks 
inherent in any building.  
Not all issues relating to good practice are covered in this Technical Handbook. 
Publications by organisations including the Royal Society for Prevention of Accidents  
(RoSPA) may offer further information relevant to the safety of occupants of, and visitors 
to, buildings.  
Accessibility - buildings should be designed to consider safety and the welfare and 
convenience of building users.  An inclusive environment is one within which everyone, 
regardless of age, disability or circumstance, can make use of facilities safely, 
conveniently and without assistance to the best of their ability. Buildings that consider 
future flexibility  
of use al so contribute to the creation of a more sustainable housing stock, simplifying 
alterations. This can allow people to remain longer in their home, through changing 
circumstances, with the minimum of disruption and inconvenience.  
The guidance in this section, together with the guidance in Section 3, Environment relating 
to accessibility, has been based around, and developed from, issues that are included in 
'Housing for Varying Needs' and the Lifetime Homes concept developed by the Joseph 
Rowntree Foundation.  
Access statements -  many designers and developers are familiar with the use of an 
access statement as a means of assisting in the delivery of more inclusive buildings. This 
records how access issues have been considered and developed from project inception, 
through all stages of development, through to the final use of a building.  
Where design proposals vary from guidance within this Handbook or, in the case of a 
conversion where a standard is to be met as far as is reasonably practicable, relevant 
informa tion extracted from a project access statement may assist in determining 
compliance.  
Security - a dwelling that is safe and secure provides a positive contribution to the quality 
of life of its occupants and contributes to the delivery of a more sustainabl e community.  
Introducing basic measures to improve security can make unlawful entry into dwellings 
physically more difficult and ensure the safety and welfare of occupants.

Page 339 Applicable from 5  June 2023   4.0.2  Aims  
The intention of this section is to give recommendations for the design of buildings that will 
ensure access and usability, reduce the risk of accident and unlawful entry. The standards 
within this section:  
* ensure accessibility to and within buildings and that areas presenting risk through 
access are correctly guarded, and  
* reduce the incidence of slips, trips and falls, particularly for those users most at risk, 
and 
* ensure that electrical installations are safe in terms of the hazards likely to arise from 
defective installations, namely fire and loss of life or injury from elec tric shock or burns, 
and 
* prevent the creation of dangerous obstructions, ensure that glazing can be cleaned 
and operated safely and to reduce the risk of injury caused by collision with glazing, 
and 
* safely locate hot water and steam vent pipe outlets, and minimise the risk of explosion 
through malfunction of unvented hot water storage systems and prevent scalding by 
hot water from sanitary fittings, and  
* ensure the appropriate location and construction of storage tanks for liquefied 
petroleum gas, and  
* ensure that windows and doors vulnerable to unlawful entry are designed and installed 
to deter house breaking.  
4.0.3  Latest  changes  
The following is a summary of the changes that have been introduced since 1 October 
2015.  
* Standard 4.14 -  Introduction of a new st andard and supporting guidance covering the 
provision of in- building physical infrastructure to facilitate the installation of high- speed 
electronic communications networks.  
* Appendix A -  Additional defined terms added. Most of these new terms are as define d 
within Article 2 of EU Directive 2014/61/EU.  
4.0.4  Relevant  legislation 
Listed below are some pieces of legislation that may be relevant and/or helpful to those 
using the guidance in this particular section.  
The Electricity Safety, Quality and Continuity  Regulations 2002 defines the duties of any 
party supplying electricity to premises with regard to matters such as supply, equipment, 
protection and provision of earthing.  
The Gas Safety (Installations and Use) Regulations 1998 require that any person who 
installs, services, maintains, removes, or repairs gas fittings must be competent. It covers 
not only materials, workmanship, safety precautions and testing of gas fittings but also the 
safe installation of all aspects of gas -fired combustion appliance ins tallations.

Scottish Ministers can, under Section 7 of the Building (Scotland) Act 2003, approve 
schemes for the certification of design or construction for compliance with the mandatory 
functional standards. Such schemes are approved on the basis that the procedures 
adopted by the scheme will take account of the need to co- ordinate the work of various 
designers and specialist contractors. Individuals approved to provide certification services 
under the scheme are assessed to ensure that they have the qualifications, s kills and 
experience required to certify compliance for the work covered by the scope of the 
scheme. Checking procedures adopted by Approved Certifiers will deliver design or 
installation reliability in accordance with legislation.  
The certification of con struction (electrical installations to BS 7671) scheme has been 
approved by Scottish Ministers to confirm compliance with relevant standards in Section 4.

Page 341 Applicable from 5  June 2023   4.1 Access to  buildings  
Mandatory Standard  
Standard 4.1  
Every building must be designed and constructed in such a way that all 
occupants and visitors are provided with safe, convenient and unassisted 
means of access to the building.  
Limitation:  
There is no requirement to provide access for a wheelchair user to:  
a) a house, between either the point of access to or from any car parking 
within the curtilage of a building and an entrance to the house where it 
is not reasonably practicable to do so, or  
b) a common entrance of a domestic buildings not served by a lift, where 
there are no dwellings entered from a common area on the entrance 
storey.  
 
 
4.1.1  Introduction 
An inclusive approach to design should be taken to ensure that buildings are as accessible 
to as wide a range of people as possible. Solutions should be integral to a design rather 
than an afterthought added in order to meet duties under building standards or other 
legislation.  
Inclusive design is not just relevant to buildings. It applies throughout any internal or 
external environment, wherever people go about everyday activities. It should be a 
continuous process, through all stages of the development of a building and involve 
potential users. Advice on this topic is available in the joint BSD/Scottish Executive  
Planning Division Planning Advice Note PAN 78: 'Inclusive Design' which promotes the 
merits of an inclusive approach to the design of the built environment.  
Whilst the guidance to this standard reflects general good practice, certain issues remain 
outwith the scope of the building regulations. There are numerous publications offering 
additional guidance on accessibility and inclusive design, includi ng those listed below:  
* BS 8300: 2009 - 'Design of buildings and their approaches to meet the needs of 
disabled people -  code of practice'  
* Housing for Varying Needs, Parts 1 & 2 -  Communities Scotland  
* 'Inclusive Mobility' - Department of Transport, 2002  
* 'Guidance on the Use of Tactile Paving Surfaces', published jointly by The Scottish 
Office and the Department for the Environment, Transport and the Regions  (DETR).  
Conversions - in the case of conversions, as specified in regulation 4, the building as 
converted shall meet the requirements of this standard in so far as is reasonably 
################# - Page 342 -  ##################

Page 342 Applicable from 5  June 2023   practicable, and in no case be worse than before the conversions (regulation 12, schedule 
6). 
4.1.2  Accessible car parking to flats or  maisonettes 
The need for c ar parking serving a domestic buildings will commonly be determined by a 
developer and may also be a condition of planning permission. Where car parking is  
provided within the curtilage of a building containing flats or maisonettes, it should include 
accessible spaces.  
A proportion of car parking spaces should be designed to be accessible to a person with 
mobility impairment, including a wheelchair user, and designated for use as such. These 
parking spaces should be:  
a. provided on a ratio of at least 1 per 20  parking spaces, or part thereof, and  
b. located on a road surface that is level (with a gradient of not more than 1 in 50), and  
c. not more than 45m from a common entrance, and  
d. clearly marked with the international symbol of access, and  
e. provided with a dropped kerb access to an accessible route, and  
f. where perpendicular or at an angle to a road, at least 4.8 m long x 2.4 m wide, outwith 
which a delineated access zone at least 1.2 m wide to each long side and between the 
end of the bay and any road is shown, or  
g. where parallel  to a road, at least 6.6 m long by 3.6 m wide, as shown below.  
Figure 4.1 Off - and on- street accessible car parking

Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 343 Applicable from 5  June 2023   4.1.3  Car parking within the curtilage of a  dwelling 
Where car parking is provided within the curtilage of a dwelling, a person should be able to 
alight from a vehicle directly onto the firm surface of an accessible route to the dwelling.  
Where a driveway or car parking space forms part of an accessible route to a dwelling, it 
should be at least 3.3 m wide to allow a 900 mm wide pedestrian route past a parked car. 
That portion of the driveway surface should be in accordance with the recommendations in 
clause 4.1.4.  
4.1.4  Accessible  routes  
Regardless of how they arrive within the curtilage of a building, a person should then be 
able to travel conveniently and without assistance to an entrance of a building. Routes to a 
building that are too steep, too narrow or poorly surfaced, or that contain steps or other 
obstructions, will make access difficult or impossible for many people. To prevent this, a 
route to an entrance should be provided that is accessible to everyone.  
An accessible route should contain no barriers, such as kerbs, steps or similar 
obstructions that may restrict access. Street furniture can present a hazard, particular ly to 
a wheelchair user or a person with a visual impairment and should be located outwith the 
width of an accessible route. Use of low -level bollards or chain- linked posts, for example, 
can be particularly hazardous.  
There should be an accessible route to the accessible entrance of a single dwelling from:  
* a road,  and 
* any car parking within the curtilage of the dwelling.  
There should be an accessible route to the common entrance of a building containing flats 
or maisonettes and to an accessible entrance of any dwelling not reached through a 
common entrance, from:  
* a road, and  
* any accessible car parking (see clause 4.1.1) within the curtilage of the building.  
Gradient of accessible route -  as steeper gradients are more difficult to negotiate, level 
or gently sloping routes should be used where possible, in preference to ramps. An 
accessible route should be:  
* level, which for the purpose of this guidance is a gradient of not more than 1 in 50, or  
* gently sloping, which for the purpose of this guidance is a gradient of more than 1 in 50 
and not more than 1 in 20, or  
* ramped, with a gradient of more than 1 in 20 and not more than 1 in 12  
The cross -fall on any part of an accessible route should not exceed 1 in 40.  
Gently sloping gradients should be provided with level rest points of not less than 1.5 m 
in length, at intervals dependent on the gradient of the sloping surface. This should follow 
the same relationship given for ramp flights, e.g. up to 20 m apart for a slope of 1 in 30,   
30 m for a slope of 1 in 40 and so on.  
Recommendations for ramps are provided in the guidance to Standard 4.3.  
################# - Page 344 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 344 Applicable from 5  June 2023   Complementary steps - ramps are not necessarily safe or convenient for an ambulant 
person with mobility i mpairment, and can be more difficult and dangerous to negotiate than 
steps. Therefore, on a route serving more than 1 dwelling, any ramped access, having a 
rise of more than 300 mm, should be complemented by an alternate, stepped means of 
access.  
There may  be stepped access to a route serving a single house where it is not reasonably 
practicable to construct an accessible route, such as on a steeply sloping site. As a 
guideline, if a ramp to an accessible entrance can be formed within the curtilage of the 
dwelling with one change in direction between the bottom of the ramp and the top landing, 
access should be considered reasonably practicable.  
Where an accessible route cannot be provided from a road, it may still be practicable to 
construct an accessible route by providing a car parking space within the curtilage of the 
dwelling. It is only where it is not reasonably practicable to construct an accessible route 
from either a road or from car parking within the curtilage of the dwelling that a stepped 
access solution may be proposed.  
4.1.5  Surface to accessible  routes  
For safety and convenience in use, the surface of an accessible route should be firm, 
uniform and of a material and finish that will permit ease in manoeuvring. It should provide 
a degree of trac tion that will minimise the possibility of slipping. This should take into 
account both anticipated use and environmental conditions.  
The surface of an accessible route, whether composed of modular paving units, formless 
materials such as tarmac, or another durable material, should have a profile that will not 
offer a trip hazard or result in standing water. It should be installed in accordance with a 
code of practice relevant to the material, where such exists.  
Surface elements such as drainage gratings and manhole covers should be of a type that 
will not create a trip or entrapment hazard. Uneven surfaces, such as cobbles, or loose-
laid materials, such as gravel, will present difficulties to many people and should not be 
used.  
Tactile paving -  at a locatio n where the footpath is level with a road surface, such as at a 
dropped kerb, tactile paving should be used to provide warning to a person with a visual 
impairment of the presence of a vehicular route. This need not apply to a route within the 
curtilage of  a single dwelling. Information on use of tactile paving on footpaths is given in 
'Guidance on the Use of Tactile Paving Surfaces'.  
4.1.6  Length of accessible  routes 
The longer a pedestrian route, the greater difficulty it can present to many people. 
Therefore, in addition to minimising gradients where possible, as recommended in clause 
4.1.3, the length of an accessible route to an accessible entrance of a building should be 
limited to 45 m.  
4.1.7  Width of accessible  routes  
The width of a pedestrian route to a building should reflect how it will be used. For 
example, most public footpaths are at least 1.8 m wide, which allows two- way traffic under 
most circumstances.  
################# - Page 345 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 345 Applicable from 5  June 2023   The clear and unobstructed surface width of an accessible route should generally be at 
least 1.8 m, unless:  
* giving access to not more than 10 dwellings, where the minimum surface width  may be 
not less than 1.2 m. This will accommodate any person where traffic is in a single 
direction of travel. To allow for passing, localised widening of any rou te less than 1.8 m 
wide to at least 1.8 m should be made at any junction and change of direction and, 
where the whole length of the route is not visible, also at not more than 10 m intervals 
along the route, or  
* giving access to a single dwelling, where eff ective width may be not less than 900 mm, 
recognising reduced levels of traffic.  
On an accessible route serving more than one dwelling, a level footpath of not less than 
1.0 m in width should be maintained to the rear of the slope of any dropped kerb.  
Any gate across an accessible route should offer a clear opening width of at least 850 mm.  
4.1.8  Accessible  entrances  
Each common entrance to a domestic buildings and at least one entrance to a dwelling 
should be an accessible, designed to present as little restriction to passage as possible.  
Whilst an accessible entrance to a house is commonly the front or main entrance, an 
alternate entrance may be designated as the accessible entrance where this provides a 
more convenient or practical route into the dwelling.  
An accessible entrance to a building should:  
a. have an unobstructed entrance platt of at least 1.2 m by 1.2 m, with a crossfall of not 
more than 1 in 50, if required to prevent standing water, and  
b. have a means of automatic illumination above or adjacent to the door, and  
c. have an accessible threshold, and  
d. have a door leaf giving a clear opening width of at least 800 mm in accordance with 
the diagram below, and 
e. if fitted with a door closing device, be operable with an opening force of not more than 
30 N (for first 30o of opening) and 22.5 N (for remainder of swing) when measured at 
the leading edge of any door leaf, and  
f. if not a powered door, have an unobstructed space to the opening face of the door, 
next to the leading edge, of at least 300 mm.  
Howev er where there is not an accessible route to a single house, the guidance in sub 
clauses (a) and (c) above need not be followed.  
Clear opening width - the projection of ironmongery which extends across the width of a 
door leaf, such as an emergency push bar for escape or a horizontal grab rail, should be 
subtracted when calculating the clear opening width.  
  
################# - Page 346 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 346 Applicable from 5  June 2023   Figure 4.2 Accessible entrance door  
4.1.9  Common  entrances  
In addition to the recommendations in clause 4.1.7, a common entrance to a domestic 
buildings should have:  
a. an unobstructed entrance platt, measuring at least 1.5 m by 1.5 m, with a crossfall of 
not more than 1 in 50 if required to prevent standing water, and  
b. a canopy, recessed entrance or similar means of protecting people entering the 
building from exposure to the elements, and  
c. a glazed vision panel, as described below, and 
d. a door entry system.  
Weather protection -  the form that weather protection should take will vary with location 
and exposure of the building. However an example of mini mum provision might be a 
canopy or recess, 750 mm deep, across the width of the entrance platt, with an underside 
not more than 2.3 m above entrance level. It is recognised that there are circumstances 
where provision of weather protection may not be pract icable or may be constrained by 
other permissions.  
Glazed vision panels -  to assist in preventing collisions, a clear glazed vision panel or 
panels to a door should give a zone of visibility from a height of not more than 500 mm to 
at least 1.5 m above finished floor level. This may be interrupted by a solid element 
between 800 mm and 1.15 m above floor level. A vision panel is not needed to a powered 
door controlled by automatic sensors or where adjacent glazing offers an equivalent clear 
view to the other  side of a door.  
Guidance relevant to specific door types such as revolving doors or powered doors is 
given in the non- domestic Technical Handbook.  
4.1.10  Accessible  thresholds  
To be accessible, a door should not present unnecessary barriers to use, such as a step 
or raised profile at a threshold that might present difficulties to a wheelchair user or be an 
entrapment or trip hazard to an ambulant person, whether or not using a walking aid.  
 

################# - Page 347 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 347 Applicable from 5  June 2023   Figure 4.3 Generic threshold profile  
 
An accessible threshold should meet the following criteria:  
* thresholds should be designed to prevent the ingress of rain. Details in the DETR 
publication 'Accessible Thresholds in New Housing' gives guidance on how this might 
be achieved  
* externally, the surface of the platt should be not more than 10 mm below the leading 
edge of any sill, with any exposed edge chamfered or rounded  
* an external sill or internal transition unit should be at an angle of not more than 15o 
from the horizontal and, if sloping, be not more than 150 mm in length 
* the threshold should either be level or of a height and form that will neither impede 
unassisted access by a wheelchair user nor create a trip hazard. A threshold piece 
should have a height of not more than 15 mm, with any vertical element of mor e than  
5 mm height being pencil -rounded or chamfered to an angle of not more than 45o from 
the horizontal  
* if the finished internal floor level is more than 15 mm below the top of the threshold, an 
internal transition unit, of not more than 15o to the hori zontal, finishing not more than   
5 mm above the internal floor surface may be used, in accordance with the guidance 
above. In new buildings, this should normally only be needed to allow flexibility in 
subsequent fitting of differing thickness of floor cov erings.  
4.1.11  Alteration and extension  
Where a dwelling is altered or extended, this work should not adversely affect an existing 
accessible entrance.  
Where a dwelling does not have an accessible entrance, one need not be provided to the 
existing dwelling , or to the extension, as this will not result in the building failing to meet 
the standard to a greater degree.  
Where an accessible entrance exists, any works should ensure that the existing entrance 
remains accessible. If this is not possible, a new accessible entrance should be provided 
elsewhere into the dwelling. Such an entrance should also maintain accessibility within the 
dwelling, as set out in guidance to Standard 4.2.

Mandatory Standard  
Standard 4.2  
Every building m ust be designed and constructed in such a way that : 
a) in non- domestic buildings, safe, unassisted and convenient means of 
access is provided throughout the building 
b) in residential buildings, a proportion of the rooms intended to be used 
as bedrooms must be accessible to a wheelchair user  
c) in domestic buildings, safe and convenient means of access is 
provided within common areas and to each dwelling  
d) in dwellings, safe and convenient means of access is provided 
throughout the dwelling, and 
e) in dwellings, unassis ted means of access is provided to, and 
throughout, at least one level.  
Limitation:  
There is no requirement to provide access for a wheelchair user:  
a) in a non- domestic building not served by a lift, to a room, intended to 
be used as a bedroom, that is not on an entrance storey, or  
b) in a domestic building not served by a lift, within common areas and to 
each dwelling, other than on an entrance storey.  
 
 
4.2.1  Introduction 
Circulation areas within a building should allow occupants to move around freely and 
without difficulty, to the best of their ability. Lack of space can make movement around a 
building difficult for many people and hamper activities such as carrying or moving large 
items.  
The design process should consider how the building can be used by as wi de a range of 
people as possible, including use by a person in a wheelchair, though it is recognised that 
this may not be to the optimum standard that can be achieved within purpose- built 
dwellings.  
Improvement to circulation within dwellings under this st andard, together with the 
provision, on one level, of an enhanced apartment, and kitchen (Standard 3.11) and 
accessible sanitary accommodation (Standard 3.12) will assist in creating more 
sustainable homes.  
Whilst the guidance to this standard reflects general good practice, certain issues remain 
outwith the scope of the building regulations. There are numerous publications offering 
additional guidance on accessibility and inclusive design, including those listed below:  
 
################# - Page 349 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 349 Applicable from 5  June 2023   * BS 8300: 2009 - 'Design of buildings  and their approaches to meet the needs of 
disabled people -  code of practice'  
* Housing for Varying Needs, Parts 1 & 2 -  Communities Scotland.  
Conversions - in the case of conversions, as specified in regulation 4, the building as 
converted shall meet the r equirements of this standard in so far as is  reasonably 
practicable, and in no case be worse than before the conversion (regulation 12, schedule 
6). 
4.2.2  Horizontal circulation in common areas of domestic  buildings  
The common areas of domestic buildings containing flats or maisonettes, though secured 
against unauthorised entry, remain in effect a public or shared area. As an enclosed 
space, it is important that provisions made on the approach to the building are maintained 
within these areas.  
There should be level or ramped access within the common areas of a domestic building:  
* from a common entrance to the entrance of any dwelling or communal facilities on the 
entrance storey and to any passenger lift, and  
* where a passenger lift is installed, fr om the passenger lift to any dwelling and to any 
communal facilities on an upper storey.  
Circulation routes within common areas should allow safe and convenient passage and 
provide space for manoeuvring at junctions and when passing through doorways. All 
corridors therefore should have a minimum width of at least 1.2 m.  
To allow manoeuvring space for both people and furniture, routes should be widened 
locally, at changes of direction, junctions and at the landing of any lift, to accommodate, 
clear of any obstruction, a 1.5 m turning circle.  
Obstructions - other than on a wall opposite a doorway, or in the areas noted above, an 
obstruction such as a radiator may project up to 100 mm, reducing corridor width to not 
less than 1.1 m, over a maximum length of 900 mm. 
Gently sloping surfaces -  within a building, unidentified gradients may disorient building 
users and the need for gently sloping surfaces on circulation routes should be considered 
carefully before use. Level rest points on gently sloping routes shoul d be provided as 
recommended in clause 4.1.3. Where not extending across the full width of a room or 
corridor, guarding should be provided to any exposed edge of such an area as for a ramp 
flight, as noted in the guidance to Standard 4.4.  
4.2.3  Floor surfa ces in common areas of domestic buildings  
Floor surfaces within common areas should be uniform, permit ease in manoeuvring and 
be of a material and finish that, when clean and dry, will provide a level of traction that will 
minimise the possibility of slip ping.  
Where there is a change in the characteristics of materials on a circulation route, such as 
from a tile to carpet finish, transition should be level and, where reasonably practicable, 
differing surfaces should contrast visually to identify the change in material and reduce the 
potential for trips.

Page 350 Applicable from 5  June 2023   4.2.4  Lobbies in common areas of domestic  buildings  
Use of a lobby can reduce the effect of external conditions on the interior of a building and 
may also contribute to fire safety. However where two sets of doors are in close proximity, 
this can present a hazard and a potential barrier to access.  
Any lobby at the entrance to or within the common areas of a domestic building should 
allow a person to pass through whilst remaining clear of the swing of doors. A rectangular 
area, outwith any door swing, of at least 1.6 m long by 750 mm wide will permit safe 
passage of, for example, a person in a wheelchair and a companion.  
Figure 4.4 Accessible lobby dimensions  
 
Where either door can be secured by a locking device, a lobby should be not less than   
1.5 m wide. This will permit a wheelchair or pram to be turned around should passage be 
denied.  
4.2.5  Doors within common areas of a domestic building 
Doors within the common areas of a domestic building should present as little restriction to 
passage as practicable and be constructed in a manner that does not present a hazard or 
a potential barrier to access.  
A door located within the common areas of a domestic building should:  
a. if fitted with a threshold, h ave an accessible threshold, and  
b. have a door leaf giving a clear opening width in accordance with the table below, and  
c. where across a circulation route or giving access to communal facilities, have a glazed 
vision panel in any opening leaf, as described in clause 4.1.8, and  
d. have a door leaf that, if fitted with a door closing device, be operable with an opening 
force of not more than 30 N (for first 30o of opening) and 22.5 N (for remainder of 
swing) when measured at the leading edge of the leaf, and

Page 351 Applicable from 5  June 2023   e. if not a powered door, have an unobstructed space to the opening face of the door, 
next to the leading edge, of at least 300 mm.

Additional information:  
1. The projection of any ironmongery that extends across the width of a door leaf, such 
as an emergency push bar to a fire exit or horizontal grab rail, should be subtracted 
when calculating the clear opening width.  
2. The clear opening width may be 800 mm where a door is approached head- on. 
3. A corridor width of less than 1.2 m should not be present within new buildings but may 
be found within some existing buildings.  
A door should not open onto a circulation route in a manner that creates an obstruction, 
other than a door to a cupboard or duct enclosure that is normally locked in a closed 
position.  
4.2.6  Vertical circulation in common areas of domestic buildings  
Stairs in common areas should be designed to be accessible to a person with reduced 
mobility, as described in guidance to Standard 4.3. There should be an accessible stair 
between each level of a building.  
Level access, or access by a stair or ramp device should be provided to any storey, or part 
of a storey. However i t is recognised that it may not be necessary or, in some cases, 
reasonably practicable to provide full access to all parts of a building. Consequently, such 
access need not be provided to any storey, or part of a storey:  
* containing only fixed plant or machinery, the only normal visits to which are 
intermittent, for inspection or maintenance purposes, or  
* where access is restricted to suitably trained persons for health and safety reasons, 
such as to walkways giving access only to machinery or to catwalks and working 
platforms, reached by industrial ladder.  
Installation of a passenger lift will allow all dwellings on upper storeys to be reached 
from a common entrance level. However it is recognised that it may not always be 
reasonably practicable to provide li ft access within all domestic buildings .  
Therefore, a building containing flats or maisonettes may be constructed without a 
passenger lift where not more than 4 storeys in height and where there is no dwelling with 
a principal living level at more than 10 m above either a common entrance level or the 
level of the lowest storey.  
In any building above this height, or where there are communal facilities on a level other 
than a common entrance level, there should be a means of unassisted access. This 
should serve each level of the building that contains a common entrance, an entrance to a 
################# - Page 352 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 352 Applicable from 5  June 2023   dwelling or communal facilities. Unassisted access between storeys should be by 
passenger lift, with the installation meeting the recommendations of BS EN 81- 70: 2003.  
Any pas senger lift should be designed and installed to include the following:  
a. a clear landing at least 1.5 m x 1.5 m in front of any lift entrance door, and  
b. automatic lift door(s), with a clear opening width of at least 800 mm, fitted with sensors 
that will preve nt injury from contact with closing doors, and  
c. a lift car at least 1.1 m wide by 1.4 m deep, and  
d. within the overall dimensions of the lift car, a horizontal handrail, of a size and section 
that is easily gripped, 900 mm above the floor on each wall not containing a door, and  
e. within a lift car not offering through passage, a mirror on the wall facing the doors, 
above handrail height, to assist a wheelchair user if reversing out, and  
f. within the lift car, tactile storey selector buttons and, in a lift serving more than 2 
storeys, visual and voice indicators of the storey reached, and  
g. controls on each level served, between 900 mm and 1.1 m above the landing, and 
within the lift car on a side wall between 900 mm and 1.1 m above the car floor and at 
least 400 mm f rom any corner, and  
h. on the landing of each level served, tactile call buttons and visual and tactile indication 
of the storey level, and  
i. lift doors, handrails and controls that contrast visually with surrounding surfaces, and  
j. a signalling system which gives notification that the lift is answering a landing call, and  
k. a system which permits adjustment of the dwell time after which the lift doors close, 
once fully opened, to suit the level of use, and 
l. a means of two way communication, operable by a person with a hearing impairment, 
that allows contact with the lift if an alarm is activated, together with visual  indicators 
that an alarm has been sounded and received.  
4.2.7  Accessibility within a storey of a dwelling  
To ensure facilities within a dwell ing can be reached and used by occupants, each storey 
within a dwelling should be designed to be accessible. There should be safe and 
convenient access to and throughout each storey other than to a level which comprises 
solely of storage and/or such accomm odation as may be accessed via a 600 mm wide 
stair. Each accessible level or storey within a dwelling should have:  
a. corridors with an unobstructed width of at least 900 mm wide. This may be reduced to 
800 mm over a maximum length of 900 mm by permanent obst ructions, such as 
radiators, or a future stair lift parking space, except on a wall opposite a doorway, and  
b. corridors that are large enough to accommodate an unobstructed area of 1.1 m by   
800 mm which, where a door being used opens into the corridor, is oriented in the 
direction of entry and is clear of the door swing, and  
c. doors with a minimum clear opening width in accordance with the following table to 
each room, including any apartment, kitchen or sanitary facility.

Additional information:  
1. The opening width may reduce to 775 mm where a door is approached head- on. 
Principal living level -  in addition, there should be unassisted access to the basic 
accommodation needed in any dwelling. The principal living level of a dwelling, normally 
also the entrance storey, should contain at least one enhanced apartment (see clause 
3.11.2), a kitchen (see clause 3.11.3) and accessible sanitary accommodation (see clause 
3.12.3). This accommodation should be either on one level or, if on different levels within a 
storey, accessible without a stepped change of level.  
4.2.8  Access between storeys in a  dwelling 
Where a dwelling has accommodation on more than one level, the levels containing 
accommodation should be connected by a stair or ramp within the dwelling following the 
guidance given under Standard 4.3.  
However the guidance under Standard 4.3 need not be applied to a fixed means of access 
leading only to a storey or level containing storage, though access to such a level must stil l 
meet Standard 4.3 and offer safe passage.  
4.2.9  Unassisted access between storeys in a dwelling 
Not everyone can use stairs unassisted. This may mean that the upper levels of a dwelling 
are not accessible to some occupants. Guidance elsewhere considers s ituations where 
occupants, incapacitated for a short period of time, might live within one storey.  
However this is not generally appropriate for longer term illness or infirmity, where a more 
permanent, inclusive, solution is required.  
Provision should be made for future installation of a means of unassisted access, both 
within a storey and between storeys.  
To allow for future installation of a stair lift , any stair giving access to a principal living 
level or to accommodation greater than may be accessed v ia a 600  mm wide stair (see 
clause 4.3.3) should:  
* have an area of wall not less than 700 mm in length, or an equivalent space, adjacent 
to the bottom riser of a stair and clear of any obstruction, fitting or doorway, to allow for 
parking of a stair lift at  rest position. This space should be not less than 400 mm in 
depth, and  
################# - Page 354 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 354 Applicable from 5  June 2023   * have a similar area of not less than 200 mm in length, on the same side of the flight, at 
landing level adjacent to the top nosing of the stair, to assist in transfer at the upper 
level, allowing for projection of a stair lift track.  
Figure 4.5 Future provision for unassisted access  
4.2.10  Split level  storeys  
Any change of level within a storey should not compromise access to facilities within the 
principal living level of a dwelling.  
A storey may be split level provided a stepped change of level does not divide the 
accommodation forming the principal living level of a dwelling (see clause 4.2.6). In 
addition, if a stepped change of level is proposed on an entrance storey containing the 
principal living level, the route from the accessible entrance of the dwelling to the 
accommodation forming the principal living level should be without a stepped change of 
level.  
4.2.11  Dwellings with limited entrance storey accommodation 
Where a dwelling, such as a townhouse or upper villa flat, contains no, or only limited, 
accommodation on the entrance storey, this can make access to the basic facilities within 
the dwelling more difficult for many people.  
Where the entrance storey of a dwelling is not also the principal living level, the first storey 
above or below entrance storey which contains an enhanced apartment, kitchen and 
accessible sanitary accommodation is considered to be the principal living level.  
Where there is not level or ramped access f rom the accessible entrance of a dwelling to 
the principal living level, the principal living level should be made accessible to as wide a 
range of occupants as possible and, accordingly:  
a. a stair, from an accessible entrance to the principal living level, should follow the 
guidance on rise, going and pitch for 'any other stair' given in clause 4.3.2, and  
b. provision for  installation of a stair lift should be made as described in clause 4.2.8, and  

################# - Page 355 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 355 Applicable from 5  June 2023   c. entrance level accommodation should contain an area of at least 800 mm wide by 1.1 
m long that would permit storage of a wheelchair or pram. This should be outwith the 
minimum corridor width noted in clause 4.2.6 and clear of any door way, door swing, 
stair landing or space identified for a future stair lift installation.  
Where the entrance level of such a dwelling contains 2 or more apartments, there should 
also be an accessible toilet on the entrance level in accordance with the guidance in 
clause 3.12.3. This is in addition to accessible sanitary facilities on the principal living level. 
There should be level or ramped access from the accessible entrance of the dwelling to 
this accessible toilet and at least 1 of the apartments on the entrance storey.  
4.2.12  Alterations and  extensions 
Where accommodation within a dwelling meets the recommendations in clauses 4.2.6 to 
4.2.10, any works to the dwelling should maintain compliance.  
Where alteration of a building includes work to, or provision of, a new circulation area, 
guidance should be followed as far as is reasonably practicable. This recognises that 
physical constraints within an existing building may mean compliance with space provision 
is not always possible.  
Consequential alterations - where existing accommodation does not meet the provisions 
set out in guidance, it need not be altered to comply except for consequential work, 
needed to ensure compliance with another standard. An example would be where an 
accessible entrance has been relocated and alterations are required to circulation space to 
maintain accessibility within the building.

Page 356 Applicable from 5  June 2023   4.3 Stairs and  ramps  
Mandatory Standard   
Standard 4.3  
Every building must be designed and constructed in such a way that every level 
can be reached safely by stairs or ramps.  
 
 
4.3.0  Introduction 
Half of all accidents involving falls within and around buildings occur on stairways, with 
young children and elderly people being particularly at risk. This risk can be greatly 
reduced by ensuring that any change in level incorporates basic precautions to guard 
against accident and falls.  
Stairs and ramps should be constructed to be within limits recognised as offering safe and 
convenient passage and designed so that any person who is likely to use them can do so  
comf ortably and safely, with the minimum amount of difficulty. Design should also address 
the issue of appropriate guarding, where a level change is made, and seek to eliminate 
any possible trip hazards.  
Explanation of terms - The following terms are explained  to provide clarity to their meaning 
in the Technical Handbooks.  
Private stair means a stair wholly within a dwelling. It may also apply to any stair within 
the curtilage of a single dwelling, which is not accessible to the public. This might include, 
for example, a stair from a dwelling to a private garden, or a stair providing access to or 
within a domestic garage. It should not, however include any external stair that forms a 
part of an accessible route to the dwelling.  
Tapered tread means a stair tread in which the nosing is not parallel to the nosing of the 
tread or landing next above.  
Conversions - in the case of conversions as specified in regulation 4, the building as 
converted shall meet the requirements of this standard in so far as is reasonably 
practicable, and in no case be worse than before the conversion (regulation 12, schedule 
6).

Figure 4.6 Measurement for stairs  
4.3.2  Rise, going, tread and pitch of  stairs 
The geometry of a stair flight can have a significant effect on the ability of people to use a 
stair safely and conveniently and limits should be placed on the rise and going of a stair, 
and steepness of pitch.  

################# - Page 358 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 358 Applicable from 5  June 2023   The pitch of a private stair flight may be steeper than that of a public flight (any ot her stair) 
in recognition that users, as occupants, will be more familiar with the stair through frequent 
use. 
To provide safe and convenient access, the rise, going, tread and pitch of a flight in a stair 
should be in accordance with the following table:  
Table 4.3 Stair geometry -  private stair  
Minimum rise 
(mm)  Maximum rise 
(mm)  Minimum going 
(mm)  Tread  Maximum 
pitch  
100 220 225 not less than going 42o 
 
Table 4.4 Stair geometry -  Any other stair, including to a domestic building or within 
the common area of a building containing flats or maisonettes  
Minimum rise 
(mm)  Maximum rise 
(mm)  Minimum going 
(mm)  Tread  Maximum 
pitch  
100 170 250 not less than going 34o 
Additional information:  
1. All rises in a flight should be of uniform height.  
2. In a straight flight, or in a part of a flight that is straight, measurement should be 
uniform along the centreline of the flight.  
3. Where a flight consists partly of straight and partly of tapered treads, the going of the 
tapered treads should be uniform and should not be less than the going of the straight 
treads.  
4. The going measured at the narrow end of a tapered tread should be at least 50 mm 
(see diagram to clause 4.3.1).  
5. The aggregate of the going and twice the rise should be at least 550  mm and not more 
than 700 mm. For example, stairs provided with the minimum going of        250 mm 
would result in rises of at least 150 mm. 
6. The maximum rise and minimum going on a private stair should not be used together 
as this will result in a pitch greater than the recomm ended maximum.  
7. Clause 4.2.10 should be referred to for exceptions where a private stair should meet 
the above recommendations for 'any other stair'.  
The most comfortable combination of rise and going varies between individuals but in 
general, a going in ex cess of the minimum, resulting in a figure in the upper end of the 
range in note 5 above, will increase both safety and amenity.  
4.3.3  Width of stair flights and landings  
The clear, or effective, width of a stair should allow users to move up and down 
unhindered and permit people to pass on a flight.  
The effective width should be measured between handrails or, where there is no handrail 
present, between any walls or protective barriers. It should be clear of obstructions, as 
################# - Page 359 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 359 Applicable from 5  June 2023   described in the diagram to clause 4.3.1. The effective width of a stair should be not less 
than 1.0 m, or otherwise in accordance with the recommendations of the following table:  
Table 4.5 Effective widths of flights and landings  
Private Stair  Any other stair  
900 mm [1], such as from one storey 
to another or connecting levels within 
a storey or  
600 mm where it serves only sanitary 
accommodation and/or one room 
other than accessible sanitary 
accommodation, a kitchen or an 
enhanced apartment.  1.0 m generally, such as to an external flight to 
a domestic building or a common access within 
a building containing flats or maisonettes, or  
900 mm to an external flight serving a single 
dwelling, to which the public have access.  
Additional information:  
1. The effective width of a private stair may be 800 mm where a continuous handrail is 
fitted to both sides of a  flight.  
The projection of any stringer or newel post into this width should be not more than         
30 mm.  
A stair lift may be fitted to a privat e stair and may project into the effective width of the 
stair. However in such cases, at least 1 handrail should be present as described in clause 
4.3.14 and, when not in use, the installation should:  
a. permit safe passage on the stair flight and any landing, and 
b. not obstruct the normal use of any door, doorway or circulation space.  
Clause 4.2.8 gives guidance on the space to be provided adjacent to a stair flight to 
accommodate a future stair lift installation.  
4.3.4  Number of rises in a  flight  
The act of cl imbing stairs can be tiring to many people. Whilst landings can provide a safe 
resting point, the flight itself is not intended to do so. The maximum number of rises 
between landings should therefore be limited.  
Generally, a flight should have not more tha n 16 rises.  
Below a minimum number of steps, it becomes difficult to signal a change of level, which 
can contribute significantly to a trip hazard.  
Generally, a flight should have at least 3 rises.  
However people tend to take greater care at certain locati ons, such as at an external door, 
and a single step or 2 steps may be appropriate under certain circumstances. There may 
be less than 3 rises:  
a. other than at an accessible entrance, between an external door of a building and the 
ground or a balcony, conservatory, porch or private garage, or  
b. wholly within an apartment other than where affecting provisions within an enhanced 
apartment (see clause 3. 11.2), or  
c. wholly within sanitary accommodation, other than accessible sanitary  accommodation 
(see clause 3.12.3), or  
################# - Page 360 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 360 Applicable from 5  June 2023    
d. between a landing and an adjoining level where the route of travel from the adjoining 
level to the next flight changes direction through 90o (i.e. on a quarter landing as the 
first step).  
4.3.5  Risers and  treads  
All stairs providing access to and within buildings should be designed to be accessible by 
most persons with reduced mobility.  
Open risers on a flight can be a hazard. When ascending a stair, people may be at risk of 
trapping the toes of shoes beneath projecting nosings, and of tripping as a result.  
In addition, many may feel a sense of insecurity when looking through spaces present 
between treads.  
A stair should have contrasting nosings to assist in identifying the position of treads and 
risers should be profiled to minimise tripping as shown below.  Open rises should not be 
used unless a stair is intended for descent only, such as in a dedicated escape stair on an 
escape route.  
Figure 4.7 Step profile examples  
 
However a private stair may be constructed with open risers and without contrasting 
nosings as occupants will be more familiar with the stair through frequent use.  
Small children can climb or fall through gaps in stair treads and the size of such gaps 
should be limited to prevent this. In a flight with open rises, the treads should overlap by at 
least 15 mm. Any opening between adjacent treads in a flight should be small enough to 
prevent the passage of a 100 mm sphere.  
4.3.6  Stair  landings  
Clear space is needed to the head and foot of any stair flight to allow people to move 
between a flight and an adjacent level surface safely. People may also wish to pause on 
stairs, particularly during ascent, and any intermediate landing should provide a temporary 
respite and be of a size to allow this whilst still permitting others to pass safely.  
A stair landing should:  
* be provided at the top and bottom of every flight. A single landing may be common to 2 
or more flights,  and 
* be level except, in external locations, for any minimal crossfall necessary to prevent 
standing water, and  

################# - Page 361 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 361 Applicable from 5  June 2023    
* have an effective width of not less than the effective width of the stair flight it serves, 
and 
* be clear of any door swing or other obstruction other than to a private stair as noted 
below.  
The minimum length of a stair landing, measured on the centreline of travel, should be 
either 1.2 m or the effective width of the stair, whichever is less. However where, on an 
intermediate landing, a change of direction of 90o or more occurs, the centreline length 
need not be measured if the effective width of the stair is maintained across  the landing.  
On landings to external stair flights, where tactile paving is used, the minimum length of 
landing should be 1.2 m.  
Flights not needing a landing -  other than at an accessible entrance, a landing need not 
be provided to a flight of steps betw een the external door of:  
* a dwelling and the ground, balcony, conservatory, porch or private garage, where the 
door slides or opens in a direction away from the flight and the total rise is not more 
than 600 mm, or  
* a dwelling, or building ancillary to a dw elling, and the ground, balcony, conservatory, 
or porch, where the change in level is not more than 170 mm, regardless of method of 
door operation.  
Obstructions - on a private stair, other than on an intermediate landing, common to 2 
flights:  
* a door to a c upboard or duct may open onto a top landing if, at any angle of swing, a 
clear space of at least 400 mm deep is maintained across the full width of the  landing 
* a door may open on to a bottom landing, if, at any angle of swing, a clear space of at 
least 400 mm deep is maintained across the full width of the landing and the door 
swing does not encroach within space designated for future installation of a stair lift 
(see clause 4.2.8).  
4.3.7  Warning surfaces to landings of external  steps 
A sudden and unguarded change of level on an access route can present a hazard to a 
person with a visual impairment. Therefore, on external routes serving more than one 
dwelling, tactile paving should be used to alert people to the presence of a flight of steps.  
The use of 'cor duroy' tactile paving identifies this hazard and advises users to 'proceed 
with caution'. It should be provided at the head and foot of any flight of external steps, 
forming a strip 800 mm deep, positioned 400 mm from the first step edge, as noted below.  
On any landing mutual to a flight of steps and a ramp, tactile paving should lie outwith the 
landing area of any ramp flight, to prevent possible confusion which might lead to injury.

General information on use of tactile paving, including options on intermediate landings, is 
given in 'Guidance on the Use of Tactile Paving Surfaces'.  
4.3.8  Stair landings serving outward opening fully glazed  doors  
Conservatories and similar extensions are an inc reasingly prevalent addition to many 
dwellings. If the conservatory or extension is intended to be the accessible entrance, the 
guidance to Standard 4.1 should be followed. If the entrance is not the accessible entrance 
and has an outward opening fully glazed door, a landing, of a length shown in the following 
diagram should be in accordance with the guidance in clause 4.3.6. These recommended 
landing lengths may also be appropriate for fully glazed doors leading from a dwelling 
directly into a conservatory . 
4.3.9  Stair flights consisting of both straight and tapered  treads  
On that part of a flight consisting of tapered treads, the going of the tapered treads should 
be uniform and should not be less than the going of the straight treads. At the inner end of 
the tread, the going should be at least 50 mm. Tapered treads on a st air should be 
constructed in accordance with BS 585: Part 1: 1989, Appendices B1 and B3, irrespective 
of material or whether it contains open rises. However guarding should be in accordance 
with the guidance in clause 4.4.2.  
In a flight less than 1 m wide the going should be measured at the centre line of the flight 
as described in clause 4.3.1. In a flight 1 m wide or more the going should be measured at 
2 points, 270 mm from each end of the tread, as described in clause 4.3.1 and the 
minimum going should be at least the going of the straight treads.

4.3.10  Stair flights consisting wholly of tapered treads 
Stairs formed from tapering treads, particularly where forming a spiral, can present  greater 
difficulties in use for many people than straight flights. There should be an appropriate 
level of safety and amenity on such stairs, particularly where used as a primary means of 
access.  
A flight consisting wholly of tapered treads, forming a hel ix or spiral, should be constructed 
to give safe passage. To achieve this, it should be constructed in accordance with the 
guidance in BS 5395: Part 2: 1984, but account should be taken of the following guidance 
clauses:  
* minimum and maximum rise should be as recommended in clause 4.3.2, and  
* the effective width should be as recommended in clause 4.3.3, and  
* the maximum number of rises on a flight should be as recommended in clause 4.3.4, 
and 
* other than on a private stair, risers and treads should be as recomm ended in clause 
4.3.5, and  
* handrails should be as recommended in clauses 4.3.14 and 4.3.15, and  
* protective barriers should be as recommended in clause 4.4.2.

and recommendations are made on such surfaces to ensure the safety and amenity of 
users. Gradients of more than 1 in 12 are considered too steep to negotiate safely and are 
not recommended.  
Steep gradients require both greater effort to ascen d and more care when descending. As 
a general principle, the steeper the gradient of a ramp, the shorter the flight should be. A 
pedestrian ramp should be constructed in accordance with the following table:  
Table 4.6 Gradient, length and rise of a flight i n a pedestrian ramp  
Maximum gradient 
of flight  Maximum length 
of flight  Maximum rise  
1 in 20  10 m  500 mm  
1 in 15  5 m 333 mm  
1 in 12  2 m 166 mm  
More than 1 in 12  Not recommended  not recommended  
Additional information:  
1. The maximum flight length for a particular gradient can be interpolated as follows: 3 m 
long for a gradient of 1 in 13, 4 m long for a gradient of 1 in 14, and so on.  
4.3.12  Width of ramps  flights  
The width of a ramp should relate to the intensity of use. For example, an unobstructed 
width of 1.8 m is the minimum that will allow two wheelchair users to pass safely. As a 
ramp flight will normally be enclosed between flanking handrails or guarding, it is important 
that this width still offers safe and convenient passage.  
The effective width of a ramp flight should be at least 1.0 m. Effective width is measured 
between handrails, or where there are no handrails, the protective barrier or inside face of 
any wall or guarding kerb, and should be clear of any obstructions.  
4.3.13  Ramp  landings  
Clear space is needed to the head and foot of any ramp flight to allow people to move 
between a flight and an adjacent level surface safely. This should permit manoeuvring of a 
wheelchair without obstructing passage or the need to encroach into circulation routes or 
onto a ramp flight.  
A ramp landing should:  
* be provided at the top and bottom of every flight. A single landing may be common to 
2 or more flights, and  
* be level except, in external locations, for any minimal crossfall necessary to prevent 
standing water, and  
* have an effective width not less than the effective width of the flight it serves,  and 
* be clear of any door swing or other obstruction.  
################# - Page 365 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 365 Applicable from 5  June 2023   The unobstructed length of a landing should be not less than 1.5 m, to allow space for 
wheelc hairs or prams to stop after travelling down a flight and to provide manoeuvring 
space.  
Where the entire length of a series of ramp flights is not visible from either the top or 
bottom landing, intermediate landings should have an effective width of not less than      
1.8 m, to provide passing places during ascent or descent.  
4.3.14  Handrails to stairs and  ramps 
Handrails to stair and ramp flights will provide support and assist safe passage. As the full 
width of a flight may be used, either by people passing or by a person who favours one 
side, a handrail should generally be provided to both sides of a stair or ramp flight.  
A handrail should be provided to both sides of any flight where there is a change of level of 
more than 600 mm, or where the flight on a ramp is longer than 2 m. However:  
* handrails may be omitted to the flight of a ramp, serving a single dwelling, where the 
change in level is less than 600 mm, and  
* a handrail need only be provided to one side on a flight of a private stair.  
Where a handrail is provided to only one side of a private stair flight, the side on which a 
handrail is not fixed should permit installation of a second handrail at a future date. A 
second handrail will provide additional support to a person using the stair and may  be 
installed provided a clear width of 800 mm is maintained.  
Figure 4.10 Handrails to stairs and ramps  
 
The extension of a handrail at landings allows an individual to steady themselves before 
ascending or descending. For a person with impaired vision, t he change in slope of the 
handrail and its return into a wall can also signal the start or finish of a flight.  
A handrail on a stair or ramp flight should:  
a. extend at least 300 mm beyond the top and bottom of the flight as shown in the 
diagram above. However the 300 mm extension may be omitted where the handrail 
abuts a newel post, and 

################# - Page 366 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 366 Applicable from 5  June 2023   b. have a profile and projection that will allow a firm grip, and  
c. end in a manner, such as a scrolled or wreathed end, that will not present a risk of 
entrapment to users, and  
d. contrast visually with any adjacent wall surface.  
However only sub clause (b) need be provided on a private stair or to a ramp providing 
access within a single dwelling, as users are likely to be familiar with the layout and use of 
the flight.  
A stair or ram p that is more than 2.3 m wide should be divided by a handrail, or handrails, 
in such a way that each section is at least 1.1 m and not more than 1.8 m wide. This does 
not apply to a stair between an entrance door to a building and ground level where not 
forming part of an escape route.  
4.3.15  Height of  handrails  
A handrail should be fixed at a height of at least 840 mm and not more than 1.0 m, 
measured vertically above the pitch line of a flight on a stair or ramp and on a landing 
where a handrail is provi ded. 
4.3.16  Headroom on stairs and  ramps 
A flight or landing on a stair or ramp should have clear headroom of at least 2.0m 
extending over the whole of the effective width. Height should be measured vertically from 
the pitch line of the flight or from the surface of the landing.  
In a dwelling where any portion of a flight or landing lies outwith the area needed to 
maintain the effective width of a flight or landing, a reduction in headroom may be 
considered, provided that no dangerous obstructions or projec tions are created.  
Figure 4.11 Headroom on stairs and ramps  
4.3.17  Industrial stairs and fixed ladders  
An industrial stair or fixed ladder serving an area in any building to which only limited 
access is provided should be constructed so as to offer safe passage. This method of

plant -rooms. A stair or ladder should be constructed in accordance with:  
a. BS 5395: Part 3: 1985 or BS 4211: 2005, as appropriate, or  
b. BS 5395: Part 2: 1984 where the stair is a spiral or helical  stair.

Page 368 Applicable from 5  June 2023   4.4 Pedestrian protective barriers  
Mandatory Standard  
Standard 4.4  
Every building must be designed and constructed in such a way that every 
sudden change of level that is accessible in, or around, the building is guarded 
by the provision of pedestrian protective barriers.  
Limitation:  
This standard does not apply where the provision of pedestrian protective 
barriers would obstruct the use of areas so guarded.  
 
 
4.4.0  Introdu ction 
Protective barriers are necessary to prevent people in and around buildings from an 
accidental fall at an unguarded change of level.  
In assessing the type of barrier to be used, the likely hazards, the use of the building and 
the risks to the people that may be present should all be considered. Any barrier should 
minimise the risk of persons falling or slipping through gaps in the barrier.  
Young children are often adept at climbing within their reach. It is important that the design 
of protective barr iers restrict the ability of young children to climb them, thereby reducing 
the possibility of injury from falls.  
Conversions - in the case of conversions, as specified in regulation 4, the building as 
converted shall meet the requirements of this standard in so far as is reasonably 
practicable, and in no case be worse than before the conversion (regulation 12, schedule 
6). 
4.4.1  Location of pedestrian protective  barriers  
In the interests of safety, protective barriers should be provided where there is a sudden 
change in level and the possibility of severe injury from a fall.  
At a change of direction on an access route, a drop of any height can be a hazard, 
particularly to a wheelchair user or a person with a visual impairment. A protective barrier 
should be provided both where a significant drop occurs and in locations where a smaller 
change of level may increase the risk of injury.  
It is not practical to provide a barrier at every change in level, but a protective barrier for 
pedestrians should be provided at the edge of:  
a. every floor, stair, ramp, landing, raised floor or other raised area to which people have 
access, where there is a difference in level of 600 mm or more, and  
b. any change in direction on an access or circulation route which is raised above the 
level of the surrounding surfaces.  
 
################# - Page 369 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 369 Applicable from 5  June 2023   However there is no need to provide a protective barrier in a location which would prevent 
intended access route or be incompatible with the normal use of an area, such as to the 
edge of a loading bay.  
A wall, partition or area of fixed glazing, constructed in accordance with the 
recommendations of clause 4.4.2, may act as a protective barrier.  
To ensure a person can be aware of the presence of a protective barrier it should, unless 
within a dwelling or forming part of a wall or partition, contrast visually with surrounding 
surfaces. If a barrier is principally glazed, the recommendations for marking given in 
clause 4.8.2 should be followed.  
4.4.2  Design of pedestrian protective  barriers  
In and around domestic buildings, gaps in any protective barrier should not be large 
enough to permit a child to pass through.  
To ensure this, openings in a protective barrier should prevent the passage of a 100 mm 
diameter sphere. However the space between a rise in a stair and t he lowest edge of the 
protective barrier may be larger than 100 mm, provided the lowest edge of the barrier is 
not more than 50 mm above, and parallel to, the pitch line of the stair.  
A protective barrier should be designed and constructed so that it cannot be easily climbed 
by young children. The provision of potential hand and footholds should be minimised.  
A protective barrier, and any wall, partition or fixed glazing accepted instead of a barrier 
should be secure, capable of resisting loads calculated i n accordance with BS EN 1991- 1-
1 and the associated PD 6688- 1-1 and be of a height as follows:  
Table 4.7 Height of pedestrian protective barriers  
 
Location  Minimum height 
(mm) [1]  
At the edge of a floor in front of walls, partitions and 
fixed glazing incapable of withstanding the loads 
specified in BS EN 1991 -1-1/PD 6688 -1-1 800 
In front of an openable window  800 [2]  
On a stair or ramp flight wholly within a dwelling  840 [3]  
On a stair or ramp flight outwith a dwelling  900 [3]  
To a gallery, landing or raised area within a dwelling 900 
All other locations  1100 
Additional information:  
1. A handrail provided in accordance with clauses 4.3.14 and 4.3.15 may form the top of 
a protective barrier if the heights in this table are met.  
2. Protective barriers should be installed where the opening window has:  
a. a sill that is less than 800 mm above finished floor level, and  
b. an operation that will allow the possibility of falling out, and  
################# - Page 370 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 370 Applicable from 5  June 2023   c. a difference in level between the floor level and the ground level of more than 
600 mm. 
At 2 storeys or more above ground level, reference should be made to clause 4.8.4 
where external glazing is cleanable from within the building.  
3. Where a handrail forming the top of a protective barrier to a flight meets a prot ective 
barrier to a landing, the height of the latter may be reduced for a distance not more 
than 300 mm to permit a smooth junction.  
4.4.3  Guarding to the edge of  ramps 
Where a continuous pedestrian protective barrier is not provided to the edge of a ramp 
flight, a kerb upstand of at least 100 mm high should be provided to any open side of the 
flight where there is a drop of any height. However the use of an upstand kerb alone in 
open landscaping is not recommended as it may present a potential trip hazard . 
Alternatively, an external ramp flight may be provided with a landscaped margin, level with 
the edge or the ramp for a distance of 600 mm before any grading.

Page 371 Applicable from 5  June 2023   4.5 Electrical  safety 
Mandatory Standard 
Standard 4.5  
Every building must be designed and cons tructed in such a way that the 
electrical installation does not:  
a) threaten the health and safety of the people in, and around, the building, and  
b) become a source of fire.  
Limitation:  
This standard does not apply to an electrical installation:  
a) serving a building or any part of a building to which the Mines and Quarries 
Act 1954 or the Factories Act 1961 applies, or  
b) forming part of the works of an undertaker to which regulations for the 
supply and distribution of electricity made under the Electricity Act 1989.  
 
 
4.5.0  Introduction 
The hazards posed by unsafe electrical installation are injuries caused by contact with 
electricity (shocks and burns) and injuries arising from fires in buildings ignited through 
malfunctioning or incorrect installations.  
Concer n has been expressed that risks have been increasing in recent years due to:  
* the increasing prevalence and variety of electrical systems in buildings and the 
demands being made on them  
* the reduction in subscription to voluntary industry self -regulation sch emes.  
The intention of this standard is to ensure that electrical installations are safe in terms of 
the hazards likely to arise from defective installations, namely fire, electric shock and burns 
or other personal injury. Installations should:  
* safely acco mmodate any likely maximum demand, and  
* incorporate appropriate automatic devices for protection against overcurrent or 
leakage, and 
* provide means of isolating parts of the installation or equipment connected to it, as are 
necessary for safe working and mai ntenance.  
The standard applies to fixed installations in buildings. An installation consists of the 
electrical wiring and associated components and fittings, including all permanently secured 
equipment, but excluding portable equipment and appliances.  
Appe ndix 6 of BS 7671: 2008 (The Wiring Regulations) provides specimen certificates that 
may be completed by the person responsible for the installation. These can be issued to 
################# - Page 372 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 372 Applicable from 5  June 2023   the person ordering the works as evidence of compliance with the recommendations of  the 
British Standards.  
'Socket outlet' means a fixed device containing contacts for the purpose of connecting to 
a supply of electricity the corresponding contacts of a plug attached to any current -using 
appliance.  
Conversions - in the case of conversions , as specified in regulation 4, the building as 
converted shall meet the requirement of this standard (regulation 12, schedule 6).  
4.5.1  Electrical  installations  
Electricity, when properly used, is a safe and convenient source of energy for heat, light 
and power within buildings. However misuse may lead to significant harm to individuals 
and buildings alike.  
Risk of fire from an electrical installation should be minimised. In normal operation, taking 
into account the surroundings, it should not create the risk of fire, burns, shock or other 
injury to people.  
An electrical installation should be designed, constructed, installed and tested such that it 
is in accordance with the recommendations of BS 7671: 2008.  
Professional Expertise -  electrical inst allation work should be inspected and tested by 
persons who possess sufficient technical knowledge, relevant practical skills and 
experience for the nature of the electrical work undertaken.  
An approved certifier of construction who has been assessed to have the professional 
skills and relevant experience, can certify compliance of an electrical installation (see 
clause 4.0.5).  
4.5.2  Extra- low voltage  installations  
To avoid the risk of harm, any circuit which is designed to operate at or below extra- low 
voltage should be protected against both direct and indirect contact with any other circuit 
operating at higher than extra- low voltage.  
Extra -low voltage is defined as not more than 50 volts alternating current or 120 volts direct 
current, measured between conductors or to earth. This might include installations for 
alarm or detection purposes, or for transmission of sound, vision, data or power.  
Any such installation should be designed, constructed, installed and tested such that it is in 
accordance with the recommendations of BS 7671: 2008.  
4.5.3  Installations operating above low  voltage  
To avoid the risk of harm, any circuit which is designed to operate at a voltage higher than 
low voltage should be provided with a cut -off switch for use in emergency in accordance 
with the recommendations of BS 7671: 2008. Such installations are not usual in domestic 
buildings .  
Low voltage is defined as not more than 1000 volts alternating current or 1500 volts direct 
current, measured between conductors or not more than 600 volts alternating current or 
900 volts direct current between conductors and earth.

Mandatory Standard  
Standard 4.6  
Every building must be designed and constructed in such a way that electric 
lighting points and socket outlets are provi ded to ensure the health, safety and 
convenience of occupants and visitors.  
Limitation:  
This standard applies only to domestic buildings where a supply of electricity is 
available.  
 
 
4.6.0  Introduction 
Visual perception increases with the level of light falling on the surface of an object. It is 
important to avoid hazardous situations that may be created by the nature of the lighting 
itself including insufficient light sources, glare, gloom and shadows.  
During daylight, lighting levels within a building are generally much less than those 
outdoors. In lobby areas, transitional lighting will assist the eye in adjusting quickly 
between exterior and interior lighting conditions. Careful design of lighting can also play an 
important part in emergency situations, to ensure the safe and effective evacuation of 
people in an emergency.  
Section 2 (Fire) includes guidance on escape route lighting and emergency lighting, whilst 
Section 6 (Energy) covers energy efficient design of lighting.  
Aside from the specific issues noted above and in guidance to this standard, general 
guidance on lighting in buildings remains outwith the scope of the Technical Handbook. 
There are, however numerous publications offering guidance on use of lighting in buildings 
for safety and am enity, including those listed below:  
* Code for Lighting -  CIBSE (2002)  
* Building Sight - Royal National Institute for the Blind (1995).  
The provision of an entryphone system to a communal entrance will enhance both the 
amenity and the security of occupants w ithin a building.  
Today, with ever more electrical appliances being used in homes, an adequate provision 
of power points reduces the possibility of both overloading of individual sockets, risking 
fire, and the creation of trip hazards from use of extension cabling.  
Conversions - in the case of conversions, as specified in regulation 4, the building as 
converted shall meet the requirement of this standard (regulation 12, schedule 6).  
 
 
 
################# - Page 375 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 375 Applicable from 5  June 2023   4.6.1  Lighting 
A dwelling should have an electric lighting system providing at least one lighting point to 
every circulation space, kitchen, bathroom, toilet and other space having a floor area of 
2m2 or more.  
Any lighting point serving a stair should have controlling switches at, or in the immediate 
vicinity of, the stair lan ding on each storey.  
4.6.2  Lighting in common areas of domestic  buildings  
In communal areas and particularly on stairs and ramps within a building, the possibility of 
slips, trips and falls and of collision with obstacles should be minimised. Lighting conditions 
play an important part in this.  
Common areas should have artificial lighting capable of providing a uniform lighting level, 
at floor level, of not less than 100 lux on stair flights and landings and 50 lux elsewhere 
within circulation areas. Lighting should not present sources of glare and should avoid 
creation of areas of strong shadow that may cause confusion or miss -step. A means of 
automatic control should be provided to ensure that lighting is operable during the hours of 
darkness.  
4.6.3  Door en try systems  
Entry to buildings containing flats or maisonettes is controlled to maintain the security of a 
private space and to prevent vandalism. Similarly, the principal entrance to a sheltered 
housing complex may have an access control system for the ge neral security and safety of 
residents.  
A common entrance door, intended as a principal means of access to a building, should 
have a door entry system installed. This should comprise of a remote door release and 
intercom at the point of entry and a call unit within each dwelling served by that entrance.  
Any unit at a common entrance should be positioned between 900 mm and 1.2 m above 
floor level. It should include an inductive coupler compatible with the 'T' setting on a 
personal hearing aid, together with a visual indicator that a call made has been received. 
Controls should contrast visually with surrounding surfaces and any numeric keypad 
should follow the 12- button telephone convention, with an embossed locater to the central 
'5' digit.  
4.6.4  Socket  outlets 
Current lifestyle places a greater demand on electrical installations, with the increase in 
use of electrical appliances. Connection of multiple appliances into a socket outlet through 
an adapter can lead to overheating and the risk of fire. Similarly,  use of extension leads 
can create a trip hazard.  
To reduce these risks, a dwelling should be provided with at least the following number of 
13A socket outlets:  
* 4 within each apartment, and  
* 6 within the kitchen, at least 3 of which should be situated above worktop level in 
addition to any outlets provided for floor -standing white goods or built -in appliances, and 
################# - Page 376 -  ##################

Sockets may be ins talled as single or double outlets, to give the recommended number of 
outlets in each space.

Mandatory Standard  
Standard 4.8  
Every building must  be designed and constructed in such a way that:  
a) people in and around the building are protected from injury that could 
result from fixed glazing, projections or moving elements on the 
building 
b) fixed glazing in the building is not vulnerable to breakage where there 
is the possibility of impact by people in and around the building 
c) both faces of a window and rooflight in a building are capable of being 
cleaned such that there will not be a threat to the cleaner from a fall 
resulting in severe injury  
d) a safe an d secure means of access is provided to a roof, and  
e) manual controls for ventilation and for electrical fixtures can be 
operated safely.  
Limitation:  
Standards 4.8(d) does not apply to domestic buildings.  
 
 
4.8.0  Introduction 
This standard covers several unrelated safety issues that do not lend themselves to 
inclusion in other standards although glass and glazing do figure prominently.  
Collision or entrapment accidents result in a significant numbers of deaths and injuries to 
people in and around b uildings every year. The majority of these accidents occur during 
normal use and involve building features such as doors, windows and areas of fixed 
glazing, with the risk of injury increased where vulnerable glass is involved. Collisions with 
glazing are very common as it can, if transparent, be difficult to see and may create 
confusing lighting effects, presenting particular difficulties for a person with a visual or 
cognitive impairment.  
Falls still result in deaths and serious injury to people while cleaning windows. Whether 
windows are cleaned professionally or by the building owner, provision should be made to 
permit glazing to be cleaned safely.  
Natural ventilation in dwellings is provided by openable windows or rooflights. People may 
encounter diffic ulty and a hazard may arise in operating controls which are poorly sited.  
Similarly, location of electrical sockets, switches and other controls can, if not considered 
carefully, affect safe and convenient use.  
Conversions - in the case of conversions, as specified in regulation 4, the building as 
converted shall meet the requirements of this standard in so far as is reasonably 
################# - Page 379 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 379 Applicable from 5  June 2023   practicable, and in no case be worse than before the conversion (regulation 12, schedule 
6). 
4.8.1  Collision with projections  
Fixtu res that project into, or open onto any place to which people have access can be a 
hazard. Any element of a building capable of projecting into a circulation route or space 
should be positioned, secured or guarded so that it does not present a risk to buil ding 
users.  
The simple way to avoid risk is to ensure that obstructions do not encroach into such 
spaces. However where a building element does project into a circulation route or space, 
and any part of the obstruction is less than 2.0 m above the ground, guarding should be 
provided to both highlight the hazard and prevent collision with the building element.  
Guarding should be provided to:  
* any moveable projection, such as a door leaf or window frame, that opens across a 
circulation route or into a circulat ion space, or  
* any permanent projection of more than 100 mm into a circulation route or space that 
begins at a height of more than 300 mm above the ground, or the projection of which 
increases with height by more than 100 mm, or  
* any accessible area where headroom reduces to less than 2.0 m, such as beneath a 
stair flight.  
Guarding should comprise of a continuous horizontal rail, at a height of between 900 mm 
and 1.1 m above ground level and a solid element, such as kerb upstand or rail, positioned 
approximat ely 100 mm above ground level, to assist in detection by a visually impaired 
person using a cane.  
There should be visual contrast between guarding rails and surrounding surfaces. 
Consideration should be given to positioning of guarding to direct a person away from the 
hazard, further reducing the risk of a collision.  
Additional guarding may be needed to prevent collision with, or entrapment by, a powered 
door leaf (see clause 4.1.8).  
Within a dwelling, guarding is not needed. A door swing may open into a ci rculation space 
provided no obstructions occur within the unobstructed area on a stair landing (see clause 
4.3.6), on a ramp landing or that would prevent future installation of a stair lift (see clause 
4.2.8).  
4.8.2  Collision with glazing 
Glazing in certain locations is more vulnerable to human impact. Care should be taken in 
the selection of glazing at low level in screens, walls and partitions or in areas surrounding 
doors, particularly where glazed side panels may be mistaken for doors.  
To reduce the ri sk of injuries from accidental human impact in these locations, designers 
should either:  
* fit glazing of a type, thickness and pane size that will be resistant to impact, which 
either does not break or breaks safely, or

Page 380 Applicable from 5  June 2023   * provide protection in the form of guarding to vulnerable glazing.  
Glazing should be designed to resist human impact as set out in BS 6262- 4: 2019, where 
all, or part, of a pane is:  
* within 800 mm of floor level, or  
* part of a door leaf, or  
* within 300 mm of a door leaf and within 1.5 m of floor level.  
Glazing manifestations -  large areas of transparent glazing, in fixed screens or partitions 
or where forming doors, can be difficult to identify and may be a particular hazard to a 
person with a visual impairment. Glazing in a building, positi oned where accidental 
collision may be likely, should be made apparent by some form of manifestation (marking). 
Differences in the design of manifestation used can also assist in identifying the position of 
doors within a glazed screen.  
Manifestation shoul d be of a size and form that is immediately obvious. It should, as far as 
is reasonably practicable, contrast visually with backgrounds viewed through the glazing 
by a person approaching from either side. Forms might include broken or solid lines, 
patterns  or logos and may be a continuous element or at appropriate horizontal intervals. 
Manifestation should be present within 2 height ranges, between 850 mm and 1.0 m, and 
between 1.4 m and 1.6 m above floor level. It should be permanent, e.g. screen printed or 
opaque etching or a durable applied material which is not easily removed.  
In addition, any unframed glazed door which operates on a pivot action should have any 
exposed vertical edge highlighted to contrast visually with surroundings, to assist in 
identi fying the door edge when opening or in an open position. This is particularly 
important on powered doors.  
Manifestation or highlighting of door edges need only be provided within dwellings where 
glazing installations are unusual. Familiar elements such as patio doors should not usually 
attract marking.  
4.8.3  Cleaning of windows and  rooflights  
Falls account for most window cleaning accidents, and generally occur from loss of 
balance through over -extension of reach or due to breakage of part of the building f abric 
through improper use or access. It is therefore important that all transparent or translucent 
glazing should be designed so that it may be cleaned safely.  
There is, however no need to provide for the safe cleaning of any glazed element that is 
opaque and does not allow the passage of light.  
Any window or rooflight, all or part of which is more than 4m above the adjacent ground or 
internal floor level, should be constructed so that any external and internal glazed surfaces 
can be cleaned safely from:  
c. inside the building in accordance with the recommendations of Clause 8 of BS  
8213:Part 1: 2004, or  
d. a loadbearing surface, such as a balcony or catwalk, large enough to prevent a person 
falling further, or  
e. a window access system, such as a cradle or travelling ladder, mounted on the 
building, as described in Annex C3 of BS 8213: Part 1: 2004.  
################# - Page 381 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 381 Applicable from 5  June 2023   Rooflight in dwellings -  however within a dwelling, any rooflight, all of which is more than 
1.8 m above both adjacent ground and internal floor level, need not be constructed so that 
it may be safely cleaned.  
Glazing in common areas -  in addition to the above three options, any window or 
rooflight within a common area of a domestic building may be cleaned from a ladder sited 
on adjacent ground or from an adjacent loadbearing surface which has unobstructed 
space large enough to allow the safe use of a ladder and which will contain a person from 
falling further. However a ladder should not be used to access any external or  internal 
glazed surface more than 9 m above the surface on which the ladder is sited. General 
guidance on the safe use of ladders may be found in HSE information sheet MISC613 
'Safety in window cleaning using portable ladders'.  
Glazing within a roof acces s hatch , located within a roof space, need not be constructed 
so that it may be safely cleaned.  
When cleaning a window from inside, a person should not have to sit or stand on a 
window sill or use other aids to reach the external face of a window. The crit erion of safety 
is the ability to reach all points on the surface of the external glazing with only the arm 
projecting outside the line of the window whilst remaining standing on the floor.  
Safe reach -  ergonomic statistics on reach capabilities for the UK  adult population are 
given in Annex A of BS 8213: Part 1: 2004. As reach may safely be increased to some 
degree by use of cleaning implements, it would still be considered reasonable to apply a 
safe limit to downward reach of 610 mm and a safe limit to lateral and vertical reach as an 
arc with a radius of 850 mm measured from a point not more than 1.3 m above floor level.  
Where the window is to be cleaned from a loadbearing surface noted in subclause (b) to 
this clause, there should be:  
* a means of safe acc ess, and  
* a protective barrier not less than 1.1 m high to any edge of the surface or access to the 
surface which is likely to be dangerous.  
This method of cleaning is only appropriate where no part of the glazing is more than 4 m 
above the loadbearing surf ace. 
Where there is a need for safe cleaning of glazing, it may be appropriate to consider 
alternate methods of cleaning, in addition to those listed in the guidance, where an 
equivalent level of safety can be demonstrated.  
4.8.4  Guarding of windows for  cleaning 
For openable windows on the ground and first floor of a building, or where the outside face 
of the glazing will not be cleaned from inside the building, no guarding need be provided 
for the purpose of cleaning glazing. However the general guidance f or provision of 
protective barriers given in clause 4.4.2 should be followed.  
At greater heights, 2 storeys or more above ground level, where it is intended to clean the 
outside face of the glazing from inside the building, the increased risk from a fall should be 
recognised and guarding provided to a height of at least 1.1 m above floor level.  
Where guarding is provided, it should be designed to conform to BS 6180: 2011. All 
guarding should be permanently fixed and should not be detachable to permit windows to 
open. Guarding should be designed so that it is not easily climbable by young children.  
################# - Page 382 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 382 Applicable from 5  June 2023   Guarding to a window is not needed where the open window gives access to a fully 
guarded balcony.  
4.8.5  Access to manual  controls  
The location of a manual control device can have a significant effect on both the ease of 
operation of the device and safety in use. Positions that are inaccessible present a greater 
risk of accident when bending or reaching. Any control that is intended for operation by the 
occupants of a building should be installed in position that allows safe and convenient use.  
This guidance is applicable to manual controls to openable ventilators, including windows 
and rooflights and to controls and outlets of electrical fixtures located on a w all or other 
vertical surface. Unless incorporating a restrictor or other protective device for safety 
reasons, controls should be operable with one hand.  
An openable window, rooflight or other ventilator, that provides natural ventilation to meet 
Standard 3.14, should have controls for opening, positioned at least 350 mm from any 
internal corner, projecting wall or similar obstruction and at a height of:  
* not more than 1.7 m above floor level, where access to controls is unobstructed, or  
* not more than 1.5 m  above floor level, where access to controls is limited by a fixed 
obstruction, not more than 900 mm high which projects not more than 600 mm in front 
of the position of the controls, such as a kitchen base unit. Where obstruction is 
greater, a remote mean s of opening, in an unobstructed location, should be provided, 
or 
* not more than 1.2 m above floor level, in an unobstructed location, within an enhanced 
apartment (see clause 3.11.2) or within accessible sanitary accommodation (see 
clause 3.12.3) not provi ded with mechanical ventilation.  
The above guidance does not apply to windows or rooflights openable only for cleaning or 
maintenance purposes or that are controlled by an automatic system, or to trickle 
ventilators.  
Electrical fixtures -  outlets and contr ols of electrical fixtures and systems should be 
positioned at least 350 mm from any internal corner, projecting wall or similar obstruction 
and, unless the need for a higher location can be demonstrated, not more than 1.2 m 
above floor level. This would i nclude fixtures such as sockets, switches, fire alarm call 
points and timer controls or programmers. Within this height range:  
* light switches should be positioned at a height of between 900 mm and 1.1 m above 
floor level 
* standard switched or unswitched soc ket outlets and outlets for other services such as 
telephone or television should be positioned at least 400 mm above floor level. Above 
an obstruction, such as a worktop, fixtures should be at least 150 mm above the 
projecting surface  
Where sockets are co ncealed, such as to the rear of white goods in a kitchen, separate 
switching should be provided in an accessible position, to allow appliances to be isolated.

Page 383 Applicable from 5  June 2023   4.9 Danger from heat 
Mandatory Standard  
 
Standard 4.9  
Every building must be designed and cons tructed in such a way that protection 
is provided for people in, and around, the building from the danger of severe 
burns or scalds from the discharge of steam or hot water.  
 
 
4.9.0  Introduction 
Guidance is given under this standard on a number of issues relating to hot water safety.  
Guidance is given to minimise the risk of explosion due to malfunction of an unvented hot 
water vessel by:  
* ensuring that such installations are carried out by appropriately qualified personnel, 
and 
* requiring a minimum r ange of safety devices be fitted to any such installation to 
prevent the temperature of the stored water exceeding 100 degC. 
It is not intended that this guidance should be applied to storage systems with a capacity 
of less than 15 litres, to systems used solely for space heating or to any system used for 
an industrial or commercial process.  
Guidance is given on systems of up to 500 litres storage capacity, where power input does 
not exceed 45 kW. Installations above this size are not usual in domestic  buildings. It is 
unlikely that many larger installations will be installed in dwellings but if required, additional 
guidance on such installations is provided to Standard 4.9 of the non- domestic Technical 
Handbook.  
Hot water overflows -  guidance is given on provision for the safe removal of the 
discharge created by the normal operation of safety devices in such an installation and on 
ensuring discharge of hot water and steam from any installation, unvented or otherwise, to 
a safe and visible location.  
Meas ures to prevent scalding from hot water are now addressed for certain sanitary 
facilities used for personal hygiene.  
Safety devices installed to protect from hazards such as scalding or the risk of explosion of 
unvented systems should be maintained to ensure correct operation. Guidance on 
maintenance can be provided by both manufacturers and installers of such devices.  
Conversions - in the case of conversions, as specified in regulation 4, the building as 
converted shall meet the requirement of this standar d (regulation 12, schedule 6).  
 
 
################# - Page 384 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 384 Applicable from 5  June 2023   4.9.1  Installation of unvented hot water storage systems  
Installation of an unvented hot water storage system should be carried out by a person 
with appropriate training and practical experience.  
This might include current membership of a registration scheme operated by a recognised 
professional body. This could include those administered by the Scottish and Northern 
Ireland Plumbing Employers Federation (SNIPEF) and the Construction Industry Training 
Board (CITB) or an equi valent body.  
The following points should be noted in relation to installation of an unvented hot water 
storage system:  
* the installer should be a competent person and, on completion, the labelling of the 
installation should identify the installer  
* the instal led system should meet the recommendations of BS EN 12897: 2006, BS 
6700: 2009 as appropriate or be the subject of an approval by a notified body and 
incorporate the safety devices outlined in clause 4.9.2  
* certification of the unit or package should be rec orded by permanent marking and a 
warning label which should be visible after installation. A comprehensive 
installation/user manual should be supplied  
* the tundish and discharge pipework should be correctly located and fitted by the 
installer and the final discharge point should be visible and safely positioned where 
there is no risk from hot water discharge.  
The operation of the system under discharge conditions should be tested to ensure 
provision is adequate.  
4.9.2  Specification of small unvented hot water storage  systems  
An unvented hot water storage system should be designed and installed to prevent the 
temperature of the stored water at any time exceeding 100oC and to provide protection 
from malfunctions of the system.  
An unvented hot water storage syst em should be in the form of a proprietary unit or 
package which is in accordance with the recommendations of a relevant standard such as 
BS EN 12897: 2006, BS 6700: 2009 as appropriate or the subject of approval by a notified 
body to an equivalent level of  safety and performance.  
Pressure controls for a unit or package could include:  
* a check valve to prevent backflow, and  
* a pressure control valve to suit the operating pressure of the system, and  
* an expansion valve to relieve excess pressure, and  
* an external expansion vessel or other means of accommodating expanded heated 
water.  
These devices are factory -fitted (unit) or supplied for fitting by the installer (package).  
A unit or package should have a minimum of 2 independent safety devices. An acceptable 
approach could be:  
* a non self -resetting thermal cut -out, and 
################# - Page 385 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 385 Applicable from 5  June 2023   * a temperature or pressure relief valve (or combined temperature/pressure relief valve).  
These devices should be in additional to any thermostatic control that is fitted to maintain 
the tem perature of the stored water at around 60 oC.  
Figure 4.12 Unvented hot water storage system -  indirect example  
Thermal cut -out - a temperature- operated, non self -resetting, energy cut -out should be 
fitted to the vessel. In the event of thermostat failure,  heating to the water in the vessel 
should stop before the temperature rises to the critical level required for operation of the 
safety relief valve.  
In indirectly heated vessels, the non self -resetting thermal cut -out should operate a 
motorised valve, or other similar device, to shut off the flow from the heat source.  
On directly heated vessels or where an indirectly heated vessel has an alternative direct 
method of water heating fitted, a non self -resetting thermal cut -out device should be 
provided for each direct source.  
The safety relief valve should be located directly on the storage vessel. The relief valve 
should comform to the relevant national standards such as BS 6283 Part 2: 1991 for 
temperature relief valves or BS EN 1490: 2000 for combined temperature and pressure 
relief valves which are set to open at temperatures not normally exceeding 90 oC.  
The relief valve should have a discharge capacity rating at least equal to the rate of energy 
(power in kilowatts) input to the heat source. In the case of an indirectly heated unit or 
package, the valve should be tested to discharge water at a rate not less than 500 kg/h for 
systems up to 45 kW. The discharge pipework should accommodate this flow rate.  
4.9.3  Discharge from unvented hot water storage system s 
The removal of discharges of water from the system can be considered in three parts.  

################# - Page 386 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 386 Applicable from 5  June 2023   Relief valve to tundish -  each valve should discharge into a metal pipe not less than the 
nominal outlet size of the valve. The discharge pipe should have an air -break, such as a 
tundish, not more than 500 mm from the vessel relief valve and located in an easily visible 
location within the same enclosure. Discharge pipes from more than one relief valve may 
be taken through the same tundish.  
Pipework should be installed so that any discharge will be directed away from electrical 
components should the discharge outlet become blocked.  
Tundish to final discharge point -  the presence of this air break results in the pressure 
of the final discharge being no higher than that of a vented system.  
The discharge pipe from the tundish to final discharge point should be of a material, 
usually copper, capable of withstanding water temperatures of up to 95 oC and be at least 
one pipe size larger than the outlet pipe to the relief valve. A  vertical section of pipe, at 
least 300 mm long, should be provided beneath the tundish before any bends to the 
discharge pipe; thereafter the pipe should be appropriately supported to maintain a 
continuous fall of at least 1 in 200 to the discharge point.  
The pipework should have a resistance to the flow of water no greater than that of a 
straight pipe 9 m long unless the pipe bore is increased accordingly. Guidance on sizing of 
pipework from the tundish to the final discharge point is shown in the followi ng table:

Annex D to BS 6700: 1997 "Specification for design, installation, testing and maintenance 
of services supplying water for domestic use within buildings and their curtilages" also 
gives guidance on pipe sizing for water distribution systems.  
Discharge pipe termination 
The pipe termination should be in a visible location and installed so that discharge will not 
endanger anyone inside or outside the building.  
Ideally, the final discharge point should be above the water seal to an external gully and 
below a fixed grating. Other methods for terminating the final discharge point would include:  
################# - Page 387 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 387 Applicable from 5  June 2023   a. up to 100 mm above external surfaces such as car parks, grassed areas, or hard 
standings; a wire cage or similar guard should be provided to both prevent contact with 
discharge and protect the outlet from damage, whilst maintaining visibility  
b. at high level into a hopper and downpipe of a material, such as cast iron, appropriate 
for a hot water discharge with the end of the discharge pipe clearly visible 
c. onto a flat roof or pitched roof clad in a material capable of withstanding high 
temperature discharges of water, such as slate/clay/concrete tiles or metal sheet, with 
the discharge point a mini mum of 3 m from any plastic guttering system that would 
collect such discharges.  
Discharge at high level may be possible if the discharge outlet is terminated in such a way 
as to direct the flow of water against the external face of a wall. However evidenc e of the 
minimum height of the outlet above any surface to which people have access and the 
distance needed to reduce the discharge to a non- scalding level should be established by 
test or otherwise.  
4.9.4  Discharge of steam or hot  water  
Any vent or overflow pipe of a hot water system should be positioned so that any 
discharge will not endanger anyone inside or outside the building.  
The discharge point of such pipework should be provided in accordance with the guidance 
given for termination in clause 4.9.3.  
4.9.5  Hot water discharge from sanitary  fittings  
Guidance to the Water Byelaws recommends that, to prevent the development of 
Legionella or similar pathogens, hot water within a storage vessel should be stored at a 
temperature of not less than 60 oC  and distributed at a temperature of not less than 55 oC.  
If water is supplied at high temperature from any source, there is a danger of scalding to 
building users. Risk of severe injury increases proportionally with increase in temperature 
and with extent  of contact.  
To prevent scalding, the temperature of hot water, at point of delivery to a bath or bidet, 
should not exceed 48 oC.  
A device or system limiting water temperature should not compromise the principal means 
of providing protection from the risk of Legionella. It should allow flexibility in setting of a 
delivery temperature, up to a maximum of 48 oC, in a form that is not easily altered by 
building users. This will allow reduction of temperature where, for example, facilities are 
used by those mor e at risk from injury, such as elderly people or unsupervised children.  
Where both hot and cold water are supplied to a facility, the above may be achieved by 
use of a thermostatic mixing valve (TMV) or fitting complying with BS EN 1111: 1999 or BS 
EN 1287: 1999, fitted as close to the point of delivery as practicable. Guidance on the 
installation, use and maintenance of thermostatic mixing valves and fittings for domestic -
scale applications may be found in BRE information Paper IP 14/03 or from the 
Thermos tatic Mixing Valve Association (TMVA).  
Where a dwelling is altered or extended, but not converted, and new sanitary facilities are 
provided, some primary heat sources, such as older combination boilers, may not be 
suited to temperature control in the manner given above. In such cases, advice should be 
################# - Page 388 -  ##################

Page 388 Applicable from 5  June 2023   sought from equipment manufacturers on compatible means of limiting hot water 
temperature to controlled facilities.  
The non- domestic Handbook should be referred to for duties under Health & Safety 
legislation relevant to any part of a dwelling used as a place of work.

Page 390 Applicable from 5  June 2023   4.11 Liquefied petroleum gas  storage  
Mandatory Standard  
Standard 4.11  
Every building must be designed and constructed in such a way that each 
liquefied petroleum gas storage installation, used solely to serve a combustion 
appliance providing space heating, water heating, or cooking facilities, will:  
a) be protected from fire spreading to any liquefied petroleum gas 
container, and 
b) not permit the contents of any such container to form explosive gas 
pockets in the vicinity of any container.  
Limitation:  
This standard does not apply to a liquefied petroleum gas storage container, or 
containers, for use with portable appliances.  
 
 
4.11.0  Introduction 
This guidance deals with non- domestic supply installations where liquefied petroleum gas 
(LPG) is stored under  pressure at ambient temperatures in fixed vessels larger than 75 kg 
LPG capacity.  
Guidance is also given on the storage of LPG within grouped cylinders, when connected to 
a supply installation.  
The intention of the guidance to this standard is to minimise  both the risk of fire spreading 
to the tank and of the contents of the tank forming explosive gas pockets in the vicinity of 
any LPG storage container.  
All persons concerned with the storage and use of LPG should be aware of the following 
characteristics and potential hazards:  
* the two forms of liquefied petroleum gases that are generally available in the UK are 
commercial butane and commercial propane  
* LPG is stored as a liquid under pressure. It is colourless and its weight as a liquid is 
approximately half that of the equivalent volume of water  
* LPG vapour is denser than air, commercial butane being about twice as heavy as air. 
Therefore the vapour may flow along the ground and into drains, sinking to the lowest 
level of the surroundings an d may therefore be ignited at a considerable distance from 
the source of the leakage. In still air, vapour will disperse slowly  
* when mixed with air, LPG can form a flammable mixture  
* leakage of small quantities of the liquefied gas can give rise to large volumes of 
vapour/ air mixture and thus cause considerable hazard  
################# - Page 391 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 391 Applicable from 5  June 2023   * owing to its rapid vaporisation and consequent lowering of temperature, LPG, 
particularly in liquid form, can cause severe frost burns if brought into contact with the 
skin 
* a container that has held LPG and is 'empty' may still contain LPG in vapour form and 
is thus potentially dangerous.  
Conversions - in the case of conversions, as specified in regulation 4, the building as 
converted shall meet the requirement of this standard (regulation 12, schedule 6).  
4.11.1  LPG storage  installations  
The type, size and location of an LPG storage installation will determine the factors that 
should be addressed in the construction of the facility, to comply with health and safety 
requirements.  
The UKLPG produces and maintains Codes of Practice which give guidance on achieving 
levels of risk appropriate to compliance with health and safety legislation for the design, 
construction and operation of LPG installations. These Codes have been produced in 
consultation with the Health and Safety Executive  (HSE).  
The operation of properties where LPG is stored or is in use are subject to legislation 
enforced by both the HSE and by the Local Authorit y. 
4.11.2  LPG storage -  fixed  tanks 
A liquefied petroleum gas storage tank, together with any associated pipework connecting 
the system to a combustion appliance providing space or water heating, or cooking 
facilities, should be designed, constructed and installed in accordance with the 
requirements set out in the UKLPG Code of Practice 1: 'Bulk LPG Storage at Fixed 
Installations'.  
Above- ground tanks should be in accordance with Part 1 - 'Design, Installation and 
Operation of Vessels Locate d Above Ground', as amended.  
Below -ground tanks should be in accordance with Part 4 - 'Buried/Mounded LPG Storage 
Vessels', as amended.  
For propane installations, above or below -ground, of not more than 2 tonnes (4500 litres) 
overall capacity, reference may be made to the simplified guidance given in the UKLPG 
Code of Practice 1: 'Bulk LPG Storage at Fixed Installations': Part 2 - 'Small Bulk Propane 
Installations for Domestic and Similar Purposes', as amended.  
Guidance given in this clause is relevant for all tanks, though specific criteria are noted for 
tanks below 4 tonnes (9000 litres) LPG capacity. LPG storage tanks in excess of 4 tonnes 
LPG capacity are uncommon in domestic applications. Guidance for larger installations is 
contained within the relevant Part of the Code of Practice.  
Every tank should be separated from a building, boundary, or fixed source of ignition, to:  
a. in the event of fire, reduce the risk of fire spreading to the tank and  
b. enable safe dispersal in the event of venting or leaks.  
Tanks  should be situated outdoors, in a position that will not allow accumulation of vapour 
at ground level. Ground features such as open drains, manholes, gullies and cellar

Page 392 Applicable from 5  June 2023   hatches, within the separation distances given in column (A) of the table below should be 
sealed or trapped to prevent the passage of LPG vapour.  
Tanks should be separated from buildings, boundaries or fixed sources of ignition in 
accordance with the following table:

resistance of short duration (Section 2, Fire) within 1 m of the boundary, and located 
between 1 m and 1.5 m from the tank and extending:  
a. longitudinally: so that the dis tance specified above without the fire wall is 
maintained when measured around the ends of the fire wall, and  
b. vertically: 2 m or the height to the top of the pressure relief valve, whichever is 
greater.  
2. For vessels up to 1.1 tonnes capacity, the fire wall need be no higher than the top of 
the pressure relief valve and may form part of the site boundary. For vessels up to 1.1 
tonnes capacity located closer to a building than the separation distance in column (A) 
of the above table, the fire wall should form part of the wall of the building in 
accordance with the diagram below. Where part of the building is used for residential 
accommodation (or as a dwelling), such a fire wall should meet the guidance for an 
external wall with a fire resistance of medium duration (Section 2,  Fire).

4.11.3  LPG storage -  cylinders  
Where an LPG storage installation consists of a set of cylinders, the installation should be 
in accordance with the UKLPG Code of Practice 24: 'Use o f LPG cylinders': Part 1 -  'The 
Use of Propane in Cylinders at Residential Premises'.  

################# - Page 394 -  ##################

Page 394 Applicable from 5  June 2023   Use of cylinders in a domestic installation commonly takes the form of 2 sets of paired 
cylinders connected to a manifold, with supply provided from one pair of cylinders  at any 
one time. This allows continuous supply to be maintained when changing empty cylinders.  
Any installation should enable cylinders to stand upright, secured by straps or chains 
against a wall outside the building.  
Cylinders should be positioned on a firm, level base such as concrete at least 50 mm thick 
or paving slabs bedded on mortar, and located in a well -ventilated position at ground level, 
so that the cylinder valves will be:  
a. at least 1 m horizontally and 300 mm vertically from openings in the buildings or from 
heat source such as flue terminals or tumble dryer  vents  
b. at least 2 m horizontally from untrapped drains, unsealed gullies or cellar hatches 
unless an intervening wall not less that 250 mm high is present.  
Cylinders should be readily access ible, reasonably protected from physical damage and 
located where they do not obstruct escape routes from the building.

Mandatory Standard  
Standard 4.12  
Every building accessible to vehicular traffic must be designed and constructed 
in such a way that every change in level is guarded.  
 
 
4.12.0  Introduction 
Where vehicles are introduced into a building, measures should be taken to protect people 
from any additional risks presented. Where areas subject to vehicular traffic are at a level 
higher than adjacent areas, such as on ramps or platforms, precautions should be taken to 
ensure that vehicles can not fall to a lower level.  
In the assessment of the type of barrier to be provided, the designer should give 
considera tion to the likely hazards, the building use and the risks to building users.  
Conversions - in the case of conversions, as specified in regulation 4, the building as 
converted shall meet the requirement of this standard (regulation 12, schedule  6). 
4.12.1  Vehicle protective  barriers  
If vehicles have access to a floor, roof or ramp that forms part of a building, a vehicle 
protective barrier should be provided to the edge of any such area that is above the level 
of any adjoining floor, ground or any ot her route for vehicles.  
When designing barriers to resist vehicular impact, an estimate of the characteristic mass 
of the vehicle should be made. Ideally, this should be determined statistically. If this is not 
possible, the characteristic mass should be t aken to be equal to the maximum mass 
anticipated. Further information on estimation of equivalent static forces for a given 
characteristic mass and displacement can be obtained in Annex A to BS 6180: 2011.  
The designer should, wherever possible, avoid intr oducing projections on the vehicular 
face of the barrier and should also consider methods of redirecting vehicles in such a way 
as to cause minimum damage after impact.  
A vehicle protective barrier should be:  
a. capable of resisting loads calculated in accord ance with BS EN 1991 -1-1 and the 
associated/PD 6688- 1-1, and  
b. of a height at least that given in the table below:  
Table 4.10 Height of vehicle protective barriers

Page 396 Applicable from 5  June 2023   The minimum height for these barriers relates to the height at which imposed load is 
applied as described in BS EN 1991- 1-1. 
In locations used by both vehicles and pedestrians, such as parking areas, additional 
barrier criteria may apply to edges and changes in level as described in clauses 4.4.1 and 
4.4.2.

Page 397 Applicable from 5  June 2023   4.13 Security  
Mandatory Standard  
Standard 4.13  
Every building must be designed and constructed in such a way that doors and 
windows, vulnerable to unlawful entry, can be secured to deter housebreaking 
and protect t he safety and welfare of occupants.  
Limitation:  
This standard applies only to domestic buildings.  
 
 
4.13.0  Introduction 
Whilst police statistics show signs of housebreaking decreasing since 1999, people's 
perception of their likelihood of falling victim to  this type of crime continues to increase. 
The 2003 Scottish Crime Survey identified that one in ten people consider it 'very' or 'fairly' 
likely that their home would be broken into within the next twelve months. This is an 
increase on the same response i n 2000 and is double the proportion of households who 
were actually victims of housebreaking in preceding years.  
As almost half of the recorded incidents of housebreaking occur when a property is 
occupied, it is not surprising that housebreaking is rated amongst the crimes that cause 
people most concern and worry. However basic measures to improve the physical security 
of dwellings, including robust specification of doors, windows, glazing and locks, can act 
deter the opportunist thief.  
Guidance to other st andards is also relevant to promoting a more secure environment as 
follows:  
* lighting of common entrances and dwelling entrances (Standard 4.1)  
* lighting within the common areas of domestic buildings and access control systems to 
common entrances (Standard 4.6)  
* ensuring security measures do not adversely affect means of escape (Standard 2.9).  
'Secured by Design' is the established police initiative to design out elements within 
development that may contribute to housebreaking and other crimes. 'Secured by Design' 
accreditation considers site design and layout as well as physical security measures and 
offers a more comprehensive solution than those p hysical provisions set out within this 
standard. As 'Secured by Design' is assessed on a site- specific basis, the police can also 
offer recommendations on appropriate additional measures in areas where the risk of 
crimes, such as housebreaking, are considered greater. Information on the scheme can be 
found online at http://www.securedbydesign.com/ . 
Conversions - in the case of conversions, as specified in regulation 4, the bui lding as 
converted shall meet the requirement of this standard (regulation 12, schedule 6).

Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 398 Applicable from 5  June 2023   4.13.1  Physical security of doors and  windows  
The two most common means of unlawful entry into a dwelling are through doors or 
windows, where these are either left  open or can be easily forced open. The level of 
security of any dwelling can be significantly enhanced by ensuring that all external doors 
and any windows or glazing in vulnerable locations are manufactured and installed to 
resist forced entry and also th at unauthorised entry into common areas is prevented.  
Doors should be designed and installed to resist forced entry at:  
* an external door to a dwelling or common area of a domestic building,  and 
* an entrance or egress door to a flat or maisonette, and  
* a door  between a dwelling and a conservatory or garage.  
Windows and glazing should be designed and installed to resist forced entry where:  
* located at ground floor level and easily accessible, or  
* where otherwise easily accessible from outside, such as by climbing on building 
projections.  
There are a number of ways in which this can be achieved:  
a. by meeting the recommendations for physical security in Section 2 of ' Secured by 
Design ' (ACPO, 2009) , or 
b. by use of doorsets and windows which are tested and certified by a notified body as 
meeting a recognised standard for security, or  
c. by use of doorsets and windows manufactured to meet recognised product standards 
and defined component performance.  
The baseline recommendations in (c) are relevant to all such doors and windows.  
4.13.2  Doors and windows - 'Secured by Design'  
'Secured by Design' (ACPO, 2009) offers a comprehensive solution to the security of 
dwellings, addressing site design and layout as well as detailed physical security 
measures. It is particularly relevant to new build or building conversions involving multiple 
units.  
A door or window in the locations described in clause 4.13.1 should meet  the 
recommendations for physical security in Section 2 of 'Secured by Design'.  
Information on Secured by Design and its application can be found online at 
www.securedbydesign.com . 
4.13.3  Doors and windows - product  accreditation  
A door or window in the locations described in clause 4.13.1 should be tested and certified 
by a notified body as meeting a recognised standard for security such as PAS 24: 2007 for 
doorsets or BS 7950: 1997 for windows.  
 
################# - Page 399 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 399 Applicable from 5  June 2023   4.13.4  Doors and windows - product standards and component  
performance  
To ensure a robust, basic standard of security, a doorset or window in the locations 
described in clause 4.13.1 should be designed and constructed in accordance with the 
general recommendations of the product standard appropriate for the material used, such 
as: 
* BS 7412: 2007, for PVCu units  
* BS 644: 2012, for timber windows and doorsets  
* BS 4873: 2009, for aluminium alloy units  
* BS 6510: 2010, for steel -framed units . 
Vulnerable windows should be constructed to resist attempts to force frames and, if 
openable, ironmongery. Windows which can be opened should be fitted with either:  
* a keyed locking system that uses a removable key, or  
* a keyless locking system, together w ith glazing which incorporates laminated glass or 
a similarly robust glazing material.  
Where a material standard for a doorset is not available, it should be designed and 
constructed in accordance with the recommendations in Annex A of BS 8220- 1: 2000, 
together with the following recommendations, to ensure a robust basic standard of 
security.  
If single swing the doorset should be fitted with at least one and a half pairs of hinges 
meeting the recommendations of BS EN 1935: 2002 for hinge grade 11 or above. Hinges 
fitted to an outward- opening door should be of a type that does not permit the hinge pin to 
be removed unless the door is open. Otherwise, hinge bolts should be fitted to ensure the 
door leaf will remain secure when closed.  
A doorset should include a single -point locking device to BS 3621: 2007 (for keyed egress) 
or to BS 8621: 2007 (for keyless egress) or a multipoint locking system. A deadlocking 
facility should be provided. Any lock cylinder should be in accordance with BS EN 1303: 
2005, grade 5 k ey security and grade 2 attack resistance as a minimum.  
To limit unauthorised access, a communal entrance door fitted with an access control 
system (see clause 4.6.3) should be self -closing and self -locking, with keyless operation of 
any lock from within t he common area. To accommodate access control systems, a 
doorset may incorporate electronic or magnetic remote release and a means of access 
which includes keyless electronic solutions (keypad, proximity swipe, etc).  
Access to door locks from outside by br eaking of glazing, in or adjacent to a door leaf 
should be prevented by use of laminated glass or a similarly robust glazing material.  
A sliding door should have a multi -point deadlocking system with 3 or more hook or similar 
bolts. To prevent removal of t he door, an anti -lift device should be fitted. Shoot bolts, if 
used, should locate into the head of the frame.  
A doorset with more than one door leaf should include a means of securing any secondary 
leaf at head and foot to allow the primary leaf to be sec urely locked.

Page 400 Applicable from 5  June 2023   4.13.5  Installation and fixing of doors and windows  
Inadequate fixing into the surrounding structure will significantly affect the security 
performance of a doorset or window. In most cases, fixings designed to resist normal 
anticipated loads, such as from wind and accidental impact, will also ensure that a doorset 
or window is secure against the more common basic methods of forced entry.  
To ensure a robust installation, fixing of a doorset or window should be in accordance with:  
* the recommendations given in section 8 of BS 8213- 4: 2007, or  
* manufacturer's written instructions where these meet or exceed the recommendation 
within this British Standard.

Page 401 Applicable from 5  June 2023   4.14 In-building physical infrastructure for high -
speed electronic communications network 
Mandatory Standard  
Standard 4.14  
Every building and building unit must be designed and constructed in such a 
way that -  
a) a high- speed ready in -building physical infrastructure up to a network 
termination point for high- speed electronic communications networ k is 
provided; and  
b) in the case of a building which contains more than one building unit, a 
common access point for high- speed electronic communications 
networks is provided.  
Limitation:  
This standard does not apply to -  
a) alterations or extensions to buildings that do not include major 
renovation works; or  
b) buildings having an area not exceeding 30 square metres, ancillary to 
and within the curtilage of a dwelling.  
 
 
4.14.0  Introduction 
Being online is not only a useful communication tool, it is also becoming increasingly 
important to individuals in their day to day lives. It enables them to access online shopping 
and banking, search for tradespeople and other businesses, interact with local and central 
government services and research many other areas o f interest. Further information on 
digital technology, including the roll -out of superfast broadband in Scotland can be found 
on the Digital Scotland Website . 
European Directive 2014/61/EU is intended to reduce the cost of rolling out high- speed 
fixed and wireless electronic communications networks. This standard and guidance 
implements Article 8 of the Directive 2014/61/EU, which requires Member States to ensure 
that newly constructed buildings are equipped with a "high- speed- ready in- building 
physical infrastructure" to facilitate the cost -effective installation of cabling providing a 
minimum broadband speed of 30 megabits per second (Mbps).  
The remainder of the Directi ve, which covers the wider network, has been transposed at 
UK level under The Communications (Access to Infrastructure) Regulations 2016.  
The main technologies for delivering high- speed broadband to residential and small 
commercial buildings are set out in  OFCOM's Infrastructure Report 2014  and consist of:  
 
################# - Page 402 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 402 Applicable from 5  June 2023   * a combination of fibre and what was originally cable television wiring -  where fibre is 
provided between an exchange and a cabinet, and the existing copper coaxial cable is 
used to deliver speeds of up to 152 Mbps  
* a combination of fibre and telephone wiring - where fibre is provided between an 
exchange and a cabinet, and the ex isting twisted pair copper phone wire line is used to 
deliver speeds of up to 76 Mbps, and  
* fibre only technology - relying entirely on fibre to connect buildings to the exchange 
and deliver speeds of up to 1 Gbps.  
The guidance to this standard provides the minimum provision necessary to meet the 
objectives of Article 8 of European Directive 2014/61/EU, with the exception of paragraph 
8(3) as there is currently no formal "broadband ready" label adopted in the UK. It should be 
noted that the standard and guidance do not consider provisions for external infrastructure 
beyond the "site" of the buildi ng, commonly known as the 'footprint'.  
Conversions - in the case of conversions, as specified in regulation 4, the building as 
converted shall meet the requirements of this standard in so far as is reasonably 
practicable, and in no case be worse than befor e the conversion (regulation 12, schedule 
6). 
4.14.1  In-building physical infrastructure in  dwellings  
A dwelling should be provided with in- building physical infrastructure to allow for the future 
installation of a service provider's network cabling and as sociated equipment to the end 
user's location, with minimal disruption to the fabric of the building.  
In a house the in -building physical infrastructure will usually consist of ducting through the 
external wall and may include the underbuilding. The type, size and routing of ducting 
should be designed to suit the technology (including cabling) that is, or may be expected to 
be, available to the building. Horizontal ductwork through external walls should slope 
downwards to the outside to prevent the possibil ity of water ingress and be fitted with 
suitable temporary seals at both ends, to allow easy access for cable installation.  
Figure 4.15 indicates one arrangement suitable for in- building physical infrastructure 
serving a single occupancy building.

################# - Page 403 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 403 Applicable from 5  June 2023   In flats and maisonettes the in -building physical infrastructure should be taken to an 
individual network termination point within each flat or maisonette. Such infrastructure may 
consist of a single duct from a main access point outside the building, leading to a 
common access point within the building, which is usually located in a communal service 
riser. The infrastructure from the common access point to the individual termination points 
may be either : 
a. a single duct, appropriately sized and designed to suit the technology (including 
cabling) that is, or may be expected to be, available to the building and should be 
continuous from the common access point to the network termination point within each 
flat or maisonette, or  
b. a cable tray taken to an appropriate point adjacent to each flat or maisonette with a 
suitably sized duct connecting the cable tray to a network termination point within each 
flat or maisonette.  
Figure 4.16 indicates one arrangement sui table for in- building physical infrastructure 
serving flats or maisonettes.  
All ductwork and cable tray installations, including those entering flats or maisonettes, 
should be designed and installed to take into account Section 2 (Fire), Section 5 (Noise) 
and Section 6 (Energy), having regard to the seals and fire- stopping, whilst allowing easy 
access for cable installation.  
Figure 4.16 Typical in -building infrastructure for flats and maisonettes  
 
Consideration should be given to any additional works that may be necessary to facilitate 
the future installation of cabling, for example draw ropes within ducts. Where the internet 
service provider is known, they should be consulted.

Although the preferred option for providing high- speed internet to the site of a building will 
usually be cable, it is recognised that there may be instances where this is not practical, 
for example  in remote areas. In such cases in -building physical infrastructure suitable for 
satellite or wireless communications should be provided in place of the infrastructure for 
cable or fibre where a minimum network speed of 30 Mbps is, or will be, available.

Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 406 Applicable from 5  June 2023   Section 5 -  Noise 
5.0 Introduction  
5.0.1  Background 
Noise is unwanted sound. In order to limit the effects of unwanted sound the standards 
intend to improve the resistance of building elements to sound transmission. Research has 
presented clear evidence that noise can indirectly contribute to a range of health issues 
such as stress and anxiety.  
Inadequate sound insulation can impair health by allowing noise from other people to 
disrupt normal life. A number  of people in attached homes complain of neighbour noise. 
The World Health Organisation has established a relationship between noise exposure 
and sleep disturbance. However, the short or long- term effects are still not clear. Over the 
years, several pieces  of legislation relating to noise (see clause 5.0.9) have been 
introduced which provide some degree of control of 'noisy neighbours'.  
Noise generated within a dwelling, to some extent, is under the control of the occupants 
but can still create tension within a family. The provision of sound absorption between 
rooms should allow people a degree of privacy as they go about their everyday activities.  
5.0.2  Aims  
The purpose of the standards in Section 5 is to limit the transmission of sound to a level 
that will not threaten the health of occupants from sound transmission emanating from 
attached buildings and a differently occupied part of the same building. They also cover 
sound from within the same dwelling if occupants are in rooms where they would expect to 
have some degree of peace and quiet.  
It is important to recognise that the standards will not guarantee freedom from unwanted 
sound transmission. The standards aim to limit the effects from sound levels created from 
normal domestic activities, but not from excessive noise from things such as power tools, 
audio systems inconsiderately played at high volume or even raised voices. The standards 
do not address environmental noise through the building facade from sources such as 
aircraft, trains, road traffic or industry. Other legislation covers these areas and further 
information may be obtained from Planning Advice Note PAN 1/2011 'Planning and Noise'.  
Home improvements were previously not considered an issue, whereas some can now 
create a noise nuisance. For example, lifting carpets and replacing them with laminate 
flooring can have an adverse affect on sound transference in buildings, and particularly on 
occupants of flats. A leaflet giving further information on home improvements is available 
at Home improvements: noise guidance -  gov.scot (www.gov.scot) . 
5.0.3  Latest  changes  
The following is a summary of the main changes that have been introduced since 1 
October 2010.  
* Standard 5.1 - removal of guidance regarding the phased introduction of sound tests; 
and references made in guidance to 'Robust Details (Scotland)'.  
################# - Page 407 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 407 Applicable from 5  June 2023   * Standard 5.2 - guidance on sound insulation level between rooms in dwellings.  
5.0.4  Explanation of  terms 
There are a number of terms used in this section some are included below, these and 
other useful terms are included in Annex A of the Example Constructions.  
Airborne sound is sound which is propagated from a noise source through the medium of 
air. Examples of these are speech and sound from a television.  
Airborne sound transmission is direct transmission of airborne sound through walls or 
floors. When sound energy is created in a room, for instance by conversation, some of the 
energy is reflected or absorbed by room surfaces but some may set up vibrations in the 
walls and floor. Depending on both the amount of energy and the type of construction, this 
can result in sound being transmitted to adjacent parts of the bui lding.  
Direct transmission refers to the path of either airborne or impact sound through 
elements of construction.  
DnT,w is the weighted standardised level difference. A single- number quantity (weighted) 
which characterises the airborne sound insulation between two rooms, in accordance with 
BS EN ISO 717 -1: 1997.  
Flanking transmission is airborne or impact transmission between rooms that is 
transmitted via flanking elements and/or in flanking elements in conjunction with the main 
separating elements. An exa mple of a flanking element is the inner leaf of an external wall 
that connects to the separating 'core' of a wall or floor.  
Impact sound is sound which is propagated from a noise source through a direct medium. 
An example of this is footfall on a floor.  
Impact sound transmission  is sound which is spread from an impact noise source in 
direct contact with a building element.  
L'nT,w is the weighted standardised impact sound pressure level. A single- number quantity 
(weighted) to characterise the impact sound in sulation of floors, in accordance with BS EN 
ISO 717 -2: 1997.  
Rw is a single number quantity (weighted) which characterises the airborne sound 
insulation of a building element from measurements undertaken in a laboratory, in 
accordance with BS EN ISO 717- 1: 1997.  
5.0.5  Reduction of sound  transmission  
The reduction of sound transmission from attached buildings, or part of the same building, 
and sound from within the same dwelling can be provided through different mechanisms 
which involve; mass, isolation, absorption, resilience and stiffness (see annex A of the 
Example Constructions). Wall and floor constructions that provide a combination of such 
mechanisms generally provide better sound insulation.  
Good design incorporates at least 2 or more of the above mechanisms and can reduce a 
range of sound frequencies typically found in attached dwellings.  
The effects these variables can have in predicting both sound transmission and insulation 
are as follows:  
 
################# - Page 408 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 408 Applicable from 5  June 2023   * through a heavyweight wall or floor it is its mass per unit area. A reduction in sound 
transmission and increase in sound insulation are expected with increasing mass, as 
the heavier the wall or floor, the less it vibrates in response to sound waves and hence 
the less sound energy is radiated. For example, heavy weight constructions such as 
masonry cavity walls provide mass and isolation  
* through a lightweight wall or floor it is the use of cavities, isolation and absorption. A 
reduction in sound transmission and an increase in sound insulation are expected by 
the use of cavities with fewer and less stiff connections, while absorptive material hung 
in the wall cavity will absorb mid to high frequency sound energy. The formation of 
narrow cavities, such as dry linings on dabs, can also create an unwelcome 'drum' 
effect at low frequencies and filling or lining them with absorbing material can help to 
reduce this. For example in lightweight constructions such as timber frame walls, the 
twin stud of the timber frame provides isolation, stiffness and absorption  
* resilience  is needed for separating floors in flats where there is direct vibration impact 
such as footfall noise. Resilience reduces the impact vibration by dynamic movement 
and also converts the energy into heat. Examples of resilient elements for floors 
include f loating floor treatments such as battens and cradles, resilient bars and 
resilient floor coverings, other than carpet  
* mass and stiffness help to reduce significantly low frequency sound transmission 
whereas absorption and resilience predominantly reduce mi d and high frequency 
sound transmission  
* isolation has the most influence over all frequencies of sound but can be limited by 
structural connections such as wall ties, straps and fixings that may bridge isolated 
leaves or elements.  
5.0.6  Principles of airborne sound  transmission  
When sound waves strike a wall or floor, the pressure variations cause the construction to 
vibrate. A portion of the vibrational energy on the sound source side will be transferred 
through the wall or floor where it is radiated as ai rborne sound on the other side. There is a 
loss in sound transmission as the frequency of the incident sound (sound waves produced 
from striking against a wall or floor for example) increases. This also varies with the 
direction of the sound waves, and is usually assumed to be the average for all possible 
angles of incidence.  
5.0.7  Principles of impact sound  transmission  
Impact sound is sound that is spread from an impact or vibrational source in direct contact 
with a building element such as a floor. A str uctural vibration is transmitted from the point 
of impact through the structure causing vibration leading to the radiation of sound into an 
adjacent room below. In a building this is commonly caused by an object hitting the floor, 
from where the vibration is transferred into the structure. Usually the vibration path will 
lead to the ceiling and perimeter walls below. The amount of impact sound heard below 
will depend upon many factors including the force of the impact, the vibration transmission 
characteris tics of the floor construction and the floor covering.

5.0.8  Principles of flanking sound  transmission  
Flanking sound transmission occurs when there is an indirect path for sound to travel 
along elements adjacent to walls and floors. If the flanking construction and its connections 
with the separating structure are not correctly detailed, flanking transmission can equal, or 
even exceed, sound levels perceived as a result of direct transmission. Fl anking 
transmission can occur, for instance, when a wall abuts the face of the inner leaf of an 
external cavity wall, and the walls are insufficiently tied or bonded together, thus allowing 
the noise to travel along the inner leaf.

Mandatory Standard  
Standard 5.1  
Every building, which is divided into more than one area of different occupation, 
must be designed and constructed in such a way to limit the transmi ssion of 
source noise from normal domestic type activities, between such areas, to a 
level that will not threaten the health of, or cause inconvenience to the building 
occupants.  
Limitation:  
This standard only applies to a building in different occupation incorporating:  
a) attached dwellings  
b) attached residential buildings, or  
c) a roof, walkway or access deck located directly above an area that is 
either a dwelling or a residential building.  
 
 
5.1.0  Introduction 
Noise nuisance outwith the control of dwelling occupants has increased substantially over 
the last decade. This is mainly as a result of people's changing lifestyles, greater numbers 
and use of sound- producing equipment and household appliances.  
There has been a dramatic increase in the use of  electrical goods, particularly sound 
producing equipment such as audio and TV. Music can be more bass orientated and 
played at higher volumes, whilst speakers mounted on walls may improve the quality to 
the listener, they can create a disturbance to other s. The intention is not to prevent all 
sound from being heard, but to limit noise nuisance by achieving levels of sound insulation 
that will help to reduce the effects of sound on people in their home.  
Complaints regarding noisy services do occur. Dealing with the varying levels of sound 
produced by service equipment, such as lifts, heat pumps or air conditioning units in 
buildings is a complex task. Guidance is given on the care that should be taken at the 
design stage in the choice of service equipment, i nstallation and location within the 
building.  
Designers should be aware that some Local Authorities may also set noise reduction 
targets. This is usually enforced through environmental health and planning legislation for 
noise emanating from commercial pre mises to dwellings, and more information on this is 
contained in PAN 1/2011.  
Conversions - in the case of conversions as specified in regulation 4, the building as 
converted shall meet the requirement of this standard (regulation 12, schedule 6).

Page 412 Applicable from 5  June 2023   5.1.1  Scope of  standard 
Airborne sound insulation should be provided where any separating wall or separating 
floor is formed between areas in different occupation. For example:  
* between dwellings  
* between a dwelling and a non- domestic building

Page 414 Applicable from 5  June 2023   5.1.2  Design performance  levels  
The following design performance levels are given for the control of sound through 
separating walls and separating floors. The levels have been developed from research 
covering sound and perceived sound in dwellings. They have been identified as levels, 
based on normal domestic activities that have been shown to produce few noise 
complaints.  
However experience shows that the performance of a construction is dependent upon:  
* achiev ing a high quality of workmanship on site 
* supervision throughout the construction process 
* the relationship between separating and adjoining elements (e.g. external walls, roofs 
and windows) to combat flanking transmission 
and these factors should be carefully considered at the design stage. All work should be 
designed to the levels in the following table.  
Table 5.1 Design performance levels in dB [1]  
Design performance  New build and 
conversions not including 
traditional bu ildings  Conversions of 
traditional buildings [2]  
Minimum airborne 
sound insulation [3]  56 DnT,w  53 DnT,w  
Maximum impact sound transmission [3]
 56 L'nT,w  58 L'nT,w  
 
Additional information:  
1. For the definition of D nT,w and L' nT,w see clause  5.0.4.  
2. Notice should be taken of the guidance on conversions in clause  5.1.5.  
3. See clause 5.1.1 for application of these performance levels to separating walls and 
separating floors.  
Two methods are provided on ways to achieve these levels which can lead to meeting the 
standard. They are by the use of:  
a. Example Constructions (see clause 5.1.3), or  
b. other constructions (see clause 5.1.4).  
These methods are to be used in conjunction with the testing arrangements (see clause 
5.1.8 to 5.1.10).  
A further method of meeting Standard 5.1 rests outwith the Domestic Technical Handbook. 
This involves using 'Robust Details (Scotland)' -  http://www.labss.org/robust -details -limited  
. If all the scheme rules are followed then post -completion testing (see clauses 5.1.9 and 
5.1.10) is not necessary.  
5.1.3  Example  Constructions  
Example Constructions have been developed that will repeatedly achieve the design 
performance levels in the table to clause 5.1.2. They have also been developed from 
################# - Page 415 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 415 Applicable from 5  June 2023   constructions that are in general use in the UK, and that are known to reduce the range of 
sound frequencies that can generate complaints.  
The Example Constructions are available on the BSD website . 
5.1.4  Other  constructions  
Clause 5.1.3 provides guidance on constructions that have been designed and tested to 
repeatedly achieve the performance levels in the table to clause 5.1.2. However it may be 
necessary, preferable or desirable, to include new or innovative constructions into a 
proposed design.  
Where constructions that hav e not been tested previously are used, the services of an 
acoustic specialist may be obtained, who should be able to offer design guidance on 
constructions that are capable of achieving the performance levels in the table to clause 
5.1.2.  
5.1.5  Conversions  
Achieving the design performance levels for conversions can present challenges to a 
designer. The presence of hidden voids within constructions, back to back fireplaces, 
cupboards and gaps between construction elements in walls and floors, mean that it may 
not be possible to use 'pattern book' type constructions to achieve the design performance 
levels. When conversions are undertaken, the adaption of the existing building should be 
considered at the design stage. Conversions and conversions of traditional  buildings 
should achieve the performance levels in the table to clause 5.1.2.  
With older buildings achieving the performance levels in clause 5.1.2 becomes more 
difficult, therefore the levels for traditional buildings are less demanding than for new buil d 
and conversions.  
The design proposals for the conversion of a traditional building should be considered 
carefully so that any measures taken will improve the sound insulation. The performance 
levels in the table to clause 5.1.2 should be considered as a benchmark, but it may not be 
possible to achieve these levels in all circumstances. Consultation on such matters at an 
early stage with both the verifier and the planning officer of the relevant authority is 
advisable.  
Historic and Listed buildings will, p rior to conversion, display unique characteristics as 
far as sound insulation is concerned. The original building design and construction will 
influence the level of sound insulation achievable for the separating walls and separating 
floors. For this reason, specific prescriptive guidance on such buildings is not appropriate. 
The relevant authority may, at their discretion, agree measures that respect the character 
of the building.  
Advice on the general principles of sound insulation in Historic and Listed buildings can be 
obtained from the Building Performance Centre, Napier University booklet  'Housing and 
Sound Insulation - Improving existing attached dwellings and designing for conversions' . 
The conversion of a roof space into a habitable area, although very common, can present 
problems as it is unlikely that access to the roof space in the adjoining dwelling can be 
assured. Where an existing separating wall in a roof space is constructed of a single leaf 
of masonry only, it would be appropriate to provide one leaf of a free -standing framed 
################# - Page 416 -  ##################

Page 416 Applicable from 5  June 2023   construction next to the existing wal l as each attic is developed. Example Constructions -  
detail 3: timber frame twin stud wall; gives a typical arrangement.  
The building owner may wish to carry out a pre- conversion sound test prior to the start of 
any conversion, ideally during the building survey process. The acoustic performance of 
the existing construction can then be established and problems identified that will allow the 
design of a tailored acoustic solution to be determined at an early stage.  
For larger or more complex work, advice on conversions may be sought from an acoustic 
specialist who should be able to offer appropriate design guidance.  
5.1.6  Doors in a separating  wall 
A door in a separating wall dividing a dwelling from a common area of a building can 
create an acoustic weak point in the wall allowing unwelcome noise into the dwelling. As 
entrance doors to dwellings from common areas must comply with the relevant standards 
in Section 2: Fire, Section 4: Safety and Section 6: Energy the doorset will be relatively 
robust, and the weakes t point for noise to enter the dwelling will be through the gap 
between the door frame and the door.  
Entrance doors to flats and maisonettes located in a separating wall should be fitted with a 
perimeter seal, including the threshold, to minimise noise transmittance through the 
doorset.  
A compressible type of seal may be used such as a rubber strip. Where the seal is of a 
type that combines a smoke and noise seal, the product literature should be consulted to 
confirm the seal will achieve the desired effect . The seal should not interfere with the 
closing mechanisms of a fire door and provide a positive seal between the door frame and 
the door.  
5.1.7  Noise from  services  
Building service installations serving common areas in domestic buildings have the 
potential to cause noise nuisance. For example, common plant such as lifts, air 
conditioning units, ventilation systems, and drainage pipes running the height of a block of 
flats have all been known to be a source of complaint.  
Therefore, it is important t hat the design of building services, their position in the building 
and the building structure should be considered at an early stage in the design process.  
Services passing through separating walls or separating floors must comply with the 
relevant standards in Section 2: Fire.  
Service pipes or ducts should not pass through a separating wall, unless they are of small 
diameter, such as lateral pipework from network risers such as gas, electricity, water and 
telecom. These pipes or ducts may pass through a s eparating wall from a common into a 
single dwelling only.  
Custom -built or system chimneys should not be built into timber -framed separating walls. 
Only masonry chimneys (including precast concrete flue- blocks) may be included as an 
integral part of a separ ating wall. However, some thickening of the construction may be 
necessary to achieve the performance levels in clause 5.1.2.  
Only service openings for ducts, service pipework or chimneys may be formed in 
separating floors. These services should be enclosed  above and below the floor with a 
################# - Page 417 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 417 Applicable from 5  June 2023   construction that will maintain the levels of noise reduction recommended for a separating 
floor in the table to clause 5.1.2.  
Service equipment rooms should not be located next to quiet areas such as rooms 
intended for sl eeping. Locating plant in a larger space can help dissipate sound. Also, 
plant machinery and equipment such as lift rails should be isolated from the walls and floor 
to reduce vibrations and the resulting sound transmission to rooms intended for sleeping. 
Vibration from mechanical equipment can be reduced with the use of inertia blocks and 
resilient mounts.  
Structure borne noise is the most common cause of complaints and the most effective 
approach is to structurally de- couple service installations and mechanical equipment from 
separating walls and separating floors. Lightweight structures need special consideration 
and it may be necessary to support noisy plant on a separate, rigid structure. The 
installation of an independent wall or ceiling lining may hel p achieve the performance 
levels in clause 5.1.2.  
A report 'Limit noise transmission to dwellings from services'  includes several useful 
design guide annexes. Annex H of BS EN 12354- 5: 2009 provides more detailed guidance 
on the reduction of service noise transmittance through separating walls and separating 
floors.  
Design guides covering low carbon equipment , such as air source heat pumps, contain 
advice on sound reduction measures and are available at Key supporting technical 
guidance - Building Standards: list of guidance -  gov.scot (www.gov.scot) . 
5.1.8  Post -completion performance test  levels  
The effectiveness of a construction to reduce sound transmission depends on several 
factors; the design, the buildings within which it is formed and the quality of the 
workmanship.  
The use of the methods in clauses 5.1.3 or 5.1.4 alone will not guarantee that the 
performance levels will be achieved. Good workmanship is essential to their performance, 
and post -completion te sting will confirm these levels have been achieved.

Additional information:  
1. Where a separating wall forms a junction with a ground floor or roof a weak point in the 
construction is created affecting the sound performance. For this reason 1 test should 
be carried out on a separating wall at ground and first floor level for attached  houses.  
2. Each different construction in a development should be tested.  
When a conversion of an attached building occurs, for example to a mid terrace dwelling, 
it may not be possible to gain access to the adjacent dwelling or part of the same building, 
to carry out tests to the separating wall. In this case, it may not be appropriate to reques t 
testing to be carried out. The conversion of a roof space into habitable space, although 
################# - Page 419 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 419 Applicable from 5  June 2023   very common can also present problems. Since it is unlikely that access to the roof space 
in the adjoining dwelling can be assured it may not be appropriate to test  
Sound tests should only be carried out on a building that is complete and when doors, 
access hatches and windows are fitted. Carpet, should not be used as bonded resilient 
floor covering or laid before an impact test for separating floors. Sound testing should be 
carried out in accordance with:  
a. BS EN ISO 140 -4: 1998 and BS EN ISO 717- 1: 1997, for airborne sound transmission, 
and 
b. BS EN ISO 140 -7: 1998 and BS EN ISO 717- 2: 1997, for impact sound transmission.  
Airborne sound insulation testing -  at least two different loudspeaker positions should 
be used for the source noise, in accordance with BS EN ISO 140- 4: 1998.  
Methods using a single source -  for each source position, the average sound pressure 
level in th e source and receiving rooms is measured in one- third-octave bands using either 
fixed microphone positions (and averaging these values on an energy basis), or using a 
moving microphone.  
For the source room measurements, the difference between the average s ound pressure 
levels in adjacent one- third-octave bands should be not more than 6dB. If this condition is 
not met, the source spectrum should be adjusted and the source room measurement 
repeated. If the condition is met, the average sound pressure level in the receiving room, 
and hence a level difference, should be determined.  
It is essential that all measurements made in the source and receiving rooms to determine 
a level difference should be made without moving the sound source or changing the output 
level of the sound source, once its spectrum has been correctly adjusted (where 
necessary).  
The sound source should now be moved to the next position in the source room and the 
above procedure repeated to determine another level difference. At least two positi ons 
should be used for the source. The level differences obtained from each source position 
should be arithmetically averaged, D as defined in BS EN ISO 140- 4: 1998.  
Airbourne and sound impact insulation testing -  for both types of testing it is possible 
to use fixed microphone positions, rotating booms or manual moving microphones (mmm), 
in accordance with BS EN ISO 140- 4: 1998 and BS EN ISO 140 -7: 1998.  
Doors - it is not normal practise to undertake sound insulation tests where there is a door 
in a separating wall, such as an entrance door to a flat from a common stair. Allowance 
should be made if a test is needed for such a separating wall as the door will not achieve 
the same 'design performance level' as a separating wall, as the door will allow sound 
transmission through the gaps and affect the sound test results.  
Professional expertise -  testing should be carried out by persons who can demonstrate 
relevant, recognised expertise in acoustics for sound insulation testing. This should include 
membership o f a professional organisation which accredits its members as competent to 
both test and confirm the results.  
5.1.10  Remedial action following a test  failure  
Noise transmission in buildings is a complex subject and it is difficult to provide definitive 
guidance on resolving specific problems that have occurred in individual buildings. It may 
################# - Page 420 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 420 Applicable from 5  June 2023   be prudent to seek advice from a specialist who, through experience of sound testing, may 
be able to identify and resolve any problems.  
If the failure is attributed to the construction of the separating and/or associated flanking 
elements, other rooms that have not been tested may also fail to meet the test 
performance levels. Additional tests may be needed, over and above the number 
recommended in clause 5.1.9 to check t hat the work achieves the test performance levels

Page 421 Applicable from 5  June 2023   5.2 Noise reduction between  rooms  
Mandatory Standard  
Standard 5.2  
Every building, must be designed and constructed in such a way to limit the 
transmission of source noise from normal domestic type activit ies, through a 
wall or floor, between a room and internal space where noise is likely to occur, 
to a level that will not cause inconvenience to the building occupants.  
Limitation:  
This standard only applies to a wall or floor forming an apartment in a dwel ling 
and a room in a residential building which is capable of being used for sleeping; 
other than:  
a) a wall between an en -suite bathroom and the apartment or room it 
serves  
b) a hospital  
c) a place of lawful detention.  
 
 
5.2.0  Introduction 
Changing lifestyles has altered the way rooms are used in dwellings. Bedrooms are more 
often used as areas where people spend time watching television, playing computer 
games and listening to music. Shouting from room to room, running up and down stairs, 
using nois y appliances and banging doors, can all be heard throughout a dwelling and can 
create unwanted noise. At night, any noise made when generally there is little background 
noise, is often perceived as excessive.  
Although noise within a dwelling, can be more easily controlled than noise from outwith the 
dwelling itself, this can still be a nuisance. The increase in noise level from speech and 
music within dwellings may indirectly lead to anxiety and stress.  
Conversions - in the case of conversions as specified in regulation 4, the building as 
converted shall meet the requirements of this standard (regulation 12, schedule 6).  
5.2.1  Design performance  level  
Internal walls are normally built off the structural floor. A door located in such a wall 
provides a path for sound to bypass a wall under test. On- site sound testing of internal 
walls and intermediate floors cannot be relied upon due to excessive flanking sound 
transmission through doors. For this reason a laboratory test is used. A laboratory test 
result is te rmed dB R w (see 5.0.4).  
As disturbance to occupants can occur from other areas within the dwelling, the level of 
sound heard should be reduced in the rooms in which people may sleep. Therefore it is 
the internal walls between apartments, an apartment and an internal space where noise is

insulation.  
The design performance levels for internal wal ls and intermediate floors covered by this 
standard should achieve minimum airborne sound insulation levels indicated in the 
following table:  
Table 5.5 Table 5.5 Design performance levels  
Design performance  Minimum airborne insulation level  
Internal walls  40 dB R w 
Intermediate floors  43 dB R w 
5.2.2  Internal  walls  
The design performance levels in clause 5.2.1 can be achieved by using the Generic 
Internal Constructions available on the BSD webs ite. Alternatively, product manufacturers 
may have solutions that will achieve the design performance level.  
5.2.3  Intermediate  floors  
Improving the sound insulation over parts of an intermediate floor only above or below 
apartments is not reasonably practicable and could lead to expensive remedial measures 
if an area is missed or if future alteration work is carried out. It is therefore recommended 
that sound insulation should be provided across the entire area of each i ntermediate floor 
in a dwelling if there is an apartment located directly or below the floor.  
The design performance levels in clause 5.2.1 can be achieved by using the Generic 
Internal Constructions available on the BSD website . Alternatively, product manufacturers 
may have solutions that will achieve the design performance level.  
Although setting impact sound insulation design levels for intermediate floors is not 
reasonably practicable, insulation against impact noise can be improved by adding a soft 
covering such as a carpet or foam -backed vinyl. However a carpet or foam -backed vinyl is 
a floor c overing and should not be included as part of the construction used to achieve the 
design levels in clause 5.2.1.  
5.2.4  Conversions  
Many of the existing wall and floor constructions within a traditional building, will be 
constructed from materials generally not still in use, for example lathe and plaster. In such 
cases the sound insulation level will not be known therefore, it is not reasonably 
practicable for the existing walls or floors to meet the performance levels in clause 5.2.1.

6.0 Introduction  
6.0.1 Introduction 
Within Scottish building regulations, improvements in energy standards have been made over 
many years including the introduction, in 2007, of emissions targets for new buildings and 
further stepped improvement in 2010 and 2015.  Earlier review  of standards was informed by 
the recommendations of The Sullivan Report (2007)  and its subsequent Update Report , 
published in 2013.  
The Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009  (The 2009 Act), which originally received Royal 
Assent on 4 August 2009, remains a key commitment of the Scottish Government and is the 
most far-reaching environmental legislation considered by the Scottish Parliament during the 
first ten years of devolution. The Climate Change (Emissions Reduction Targets)  (Scotland)  
Act 2019  (The 2019 Act),  which  amends  The 2009  Act, sets targets  to reduce Scotland's 
emissions of all greenhouse gases to net-zero by 2045 at the latest, with interim targets for 
reductions of at least 75% by 2030 and 90% by 2040. Our target of net -zero emissions by 
2045, five years ahead of the rest of the UK, is firmly based on what the independent 
Committee on Climate Change (CCC) advise is the limit of what can currently be achieved. 
The levels of all of Scotland's targets are regularly reviewed following advice from the CCC.  
We published our Climate Change Plan update in December 2020 which reflects the 
increased ambition of The 2019 Ac t. This update maintains the commitment to investigate 
the potential for further, significant improvement on 2015 energy standards and also how 
building regulations can support the achievement of these targets and other emissions and 
energy policy outcomes , including our decarbonisation of heat agenda.  
Building on the policies and actions set out in the 2020 Climate Change Plan update, the 
2021 Heat in Buildings Strategy sets out a pathway to zero emissions buildings by 2045 and 
details a series of near -term actions to put us on a clear path towards this, as well as a range 
of further, longer -term commitments to accelerate and further scale the transformation of the 
nation's building stock.  
Heating and powering buildings currently accounts for 40% of the UK's total energy usage, 
a figure which must be both significantly reduced and delivered through a transition to low 
and zero emissions heating systems if we are to achieve our goal of net zero by 2040.  
2024 New Build Heat Standard  
As part of our Heat in Buildings Strategy, the Scottish Government is committed to ensuring 
that, from 2024, new buildings must use heating systems which produce zero direct 
emissions at the point of use. A scoping consultation  on proposals was undertaken from 
December 2020 to March 2021 which set out our high- level vision for the new Standard. 
This focused upon regulat ion of new buildings to meet the commitment set out in the 2019 
Programme for Government  to require new buildings to use renewable or low carbon heat.  
As of June 2022, The Scottish Government is currently developing more detailed proposals 
for further consultation on this issue. Provisions within these energy standards are framed in 
the context of the anti cipated exclusion of 'direct emissions heating systems' from new 
################# - Page 425 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition   
 
Page 425 Applicable from 5  June 2023  buildings in the very near future. Specific provisions which support the New Build Heat 
Standards are noted in the list of changes in clause 6.0.12.  
6.0.2  Aims  
Review for 2022 considered the technical, commercial and wider policy implications of 
improvements to energy standards and offered proposals, as part of broader action by the 
Scottish Government on climate change, to further our ambition of becoming a net - zero 
society by  2045.  
The intention of Section 6 is to ensure that effective measures for the conservation of fuel 
and power are incorporated within dwellings and buildings consisting of dwellings. In 
addition to limiting energy demand, by addressing the performance of t he building fabric and 
fixed building services, a delivered energy and carbon dioxide emissions standard obliges a 
designer of new dwellings to consider building design in a holistic way.  
Improvements set out within this section will result in a greater need to consider the benefits 
which very good levels of insulation, high efficiency heating solutions and effective use of 
on-site generation of heat or power can offer towards meeting standards. With the stated 
ambition of moving away from direct emission heating systems, the standards are focussed 
on measures which are effective in reducing the total delivered energy needed at a building. 
A new energy target for new homes is introduced in recognition of the refocussing of 
emphasis as our Heat in Buildings S trategy continues to be implemented.  
Ongoing parallel work seeks to improve compliance with building regulations and, 
accordingly providing more assurance that designed energy performance is achieved. That 
and these new standards will increase assurance that, for new homes and new building 
work, use of energy and fuel costs arising from such use are both minimised.  
The standards and guidance given in this section are intended to achieve an improvement, 
for new homes, reducing emissions by approximately 32% compared to the previous 2015 
standards. However, nothing here prevents a domestic building from being designed and 
constructed to be even more energy efficient in its construction or make greater use of non -
direct emissions heating systems or effective so urces of on - site generation of heat or 
power.  
6.0.3  General  guidance  
This section addresses the energy use and associated greenhouse emissions energy 
performance of all domestic buildings (houses, flats and maisonettes) and ancillary 
buildings. In respect  of dwellings, all parts of a building intended to form part of  
the dwelling should be within an insulation envelope.  
This section should be read in conjunction with all the guidance to the Building (Scotland) 
Regulations 2004 but in particular Section 3: Environment has a close affiliation with energy 
efficiency, regarding:  
* heating of  dwellings  
* ventilation of domestic  buildings  
* condensation  
* natural  lighting  
################# - Page 426 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition   
 
Page 426 Applicable from 5  June 2023  * combustion  air and cooling  air for combustion appliances  
* drying facilities  
* storage of woody biomass,  and 
* overheating.  
Other than where qualified in the limitations to individual functional standards, the standards 
and guidance within this section apply, irrespective of the intended lifespan or the potential 
to relocate a building:  
* to dwellings  
* to ancilla ry and subsidiary  accommodation to dwellings  (some  of which  may be stand - 
alone  buildings),  that are to be heated  (excepting heating rated at a maximum  of 25 W/m2  
floor area,  installed  solely  for the purpose of frost protection)  
* to stand -alone buildings  that are heated (see paragraph below),  and 
* to work on existing  buildings  (see paragraph below).  
Heated stand -alone buildings include not only detached buildings, but also thermally 
divided parts of a buildings with separate heating shut -down control. Stand- alone building 
that are less than 50 m2 in floor area are not subject to overall energy or emissions targets 
set under standard 6.1 or energy certification on construction under standard 6.9. However, 
they must still comply with Standards 6.2 to 6.8 (6.10 not being applicable to domestic 
buildings). The guidance to Standard 6.2 recommends that the insulation envelope of such 
a building should achieve the level of performance applicable to any new building or 
extension.  
Work  on existing  buildings  - as for other  standards  within  Scottish  building regulations, the 
energy standards apply to conversions and also work on existing buil dings, such as 
extensions, conservatories, alterations and replacement work. However, in some situations, 
individual standards may not apply or guidance on compliance with the standards may differ 
for such work. The latter is usually to recognise constraints that arise when working with 
existing  buildings.  
It is advisable, in the first instance, to check the functional standard as sometimes a 
limitation removes certain classes of this type of work. Where not excepted by a limitation to 
a standard, the provisions of the standard will apply in full to the new work on the existing 
building, other than where proposed works are wholly categorised as a conversion, where 
the standard in question may be met as far as is reasonably practicable. Thi s is identified in 
the introduction to the guidance supporting each standard.  
6.0.4  U-values  
Thermal transmittance (U -value) is a measure of how much heat will pass through one 
square metre of a structure when the temperature on either side differs by one degree 
Celsius. It is expressed in units of watts per square metre per degree of temperature 
difference (W/m2K). 
Measurements of U -values should be made in accordance with BS EN ISO 8990:1996 -  
'Thermal insulation. Determination of steady -state thermal  transmission properties. 
Calibrated and guarded hot box'. In calculation, thermal bridging may be disregarded where 
the difference in thermal resistance between bridging and bridged material is less than 0.1 
################# - Page 427 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition   
 
Page 427 Applicable from 5  June 2023  m2K/W. For example, normal mortar joints need n ot be taken into account in calculations for 
brickwork, but should be taken into account for lightweight insulating blockwork.  
Taking into account guidance from BRE publication BR 443:2019 'Conventions for U - value 
calculations', individual U -values of bui lding elements forming the insulation envelope can 
be established by a number of methods, including:  
* by using insulation to a thickness derived from manufacturers' data relating to thermal 
conductivities (W/mK) and thermal transmittances (U -values: W/m2K) certified by a 
notified  body  
* by calculation, taking into account thermal bridging effects of, e.g. timber joists, structural 
and other framing and normal bedding mortar, by using the Combined Method set out in 
BS EN ISO 6946:2017.  
* for floors adjacent to the ground and basements, by using the method set out in BS EN 
ISO 13370: 2017,  or 
* for windows, doors and rooflights, by using BS EN ISO 10077- 1: 2017 or BS EN ISO 
10077- 2: 2017 and, for rooflights, BS EN ISO 12567- 2: 2005.  
6.0.5  Thermal  conductivity 
The thermal conductivity (the l -value)  of a material is a measure of the rate at which that 
material will transmit heat and is expressed in units of watts per metre per degree of 
temperature difference (W/mK). Establishing the thermal conduct ivity of materials in a 
building element forming part of the insulation envelope will enable the thermal 
transmittance of the element to be calculated.  
Measurements of thermal conductivity should be made in accordance with BS EN 12664: 
2001, BS EN 12667: 2001 or BS EN 12939: 2001. There are a wide range of technical 
publications which give the thermal conductivity of common construction materials but, 
where available, preference should be given  to values that are certified by a notified body. 
Additional guidance given in BRE publication BR 443: 2019 should also be followed.  
6.0.6  Thermal  transmittance  through separating  elements 
Heat loss through a separating construction between a heated part of a dwelling and an 
unheated area is always assessed. Separating walls between a dwelling and other heated 
parts of the same building (e.g. between a flat and a protected zone with space heating) are 
also assessed. Whilst 'no loss' may still be assumed for solid walls, heat losses from air 
movement in cavity separating walls ('thermal bypass') is identified in the calculation 
methodology and guidance to Standard 6.1 and in guidance to Standard 6.2.  
6.0.7  Buffering  effects on the insulation envelope  
If a dwelling or part of a building consisting of dwellings is  separated from an unheated 
enclosed area, (for example solid waste storage accommodation, a porch, garage, 
protected zone or underground car park) the U -values of the walls/floors (including doors 
and translucent glazing) may be calculated by:  
* disregardin g the buffering effects and treating the element as if it is directly exposed to 
the outside  
################# - Page 428 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition   
 
Page 428 Applicable from 5  June 2023  * using the relevant formulae within SAP 10; 
* following the procedure in BS EN ISO 6946: 2017,  or 
* following the procedure in BS EN ISO 13789:  2017.  
6.0.8  Roofs  that perform  the function  of a floor 
A roof of a dwelling or building consisting of dwellings that also performs the function of a 
floor or similar loadbearing surface (e.g. an access deck, escape route, roof garden or car 
park), should be considered as a roof for the purpose of assessment within this section.  
6.0.9  Conservatories  and atria  
A conservatory allows natural light and natural ventilation to be 'borrowed' through glazing 
and ventilators into adjacent rooms of a dwelling. In view of this, a large area of translucent 
material is required in the conservatory fabric to ensure that such rooms are not adversely 
affected. The definition of conservatory in Appendix A of the Technical Handbooks should 
be read in conjunc tion with the SAP 10 document.  
Further guidance is given on how the standards apply to conservatories in clauses 6.1.6, 
6.2.11 and 6.3.1.  
In a dwelling with an atrium, it should be assumed that the atrium is to gain heat transfer 
from the surrounding build ing. The continuity of the insulation envelope  occurs at the roof 
level (usually predominantly glazed with translucent material) and the atrium is considered to 
be a heated part of the  dwelling.  
6.0.10  Performance of fixed  building  services  
Unless otherwise identified in text, guidance given in support of Standards 6.3 to 6.6 now 
refers directly to information contained within the Domestic Building Services Compliance 
Guide 2023 .  The document replicates  published in support of building standards elsewhere 
in the UK and supports standardisation of the specification and expected performa nce of 
fixed building services throughout the UK. The Guide also provides helpful supplementary 
information that may assist designers in the installation and commissioning of services to 
delivering  optimum operating efficiency.  
6.0.11  Calculation of  areas  
When calculating areas for the purposes of this section and in addition to regulation 7, 
schedule 4, the following should be observed:  
* all areas should be measured in square metres (m2), unless stated otherwise in this 
guidance  
* the area of a floor, wall or roof is to be measured between finished internal faces of the 
insulation envelope, including any projecting bays and in the case of a roof, in the plane 
of the  insulation  
* floor areas are to include stairwells within the insulation envelope and also non- useable 
space (for example service  ducts)

Page 429 Applicable from 5  June 2023  * the area of an opening (e.g. window or door) should be measured internally from ingo to 
ingo and from head to sill or threshold.  
6.0.12  Latest  changes  
The 2023 edition of Section 6 incorporates a number of changes whilst also introducing the 
use of SAP 10  for compliance calculations and EPC production for new dwellings. The 
majority of these changes relate to improvement in specified performance to deliver the 
intended 32% aggregate reduction in carbon dioxide emissions on the 2015 standards and 
to support the planned implementation of the 2024 New Build Heat Standard.  
A fuller summary of changes can be  found on the Technical Handbooks  page of the Building 
Standards Division section of the Scottish Government website.  
The key changes that have been made to the standards and guidance from 1 February 
2023 include:  
* Standard 6.1 amended  to introduce a new energy  target  for new buildings.  
* Standard  6.1 amended  to apply  requirements  to reduce  carbon dioxide  emission  only to 
new buildings  using  direct  emissions  heating systems.  Note:  definition of 'direct  emission 
heating system"  introduced  under  regulation 2. 
* Clause  6.1.1  - explanation of new energy  target  and exemption  from TER for non-direct 
emission  heating  systems.  Confirmation of application of SAP 10 as the current  version of

generation of power and of the amended approach to compliance for dwellings connected 
to a heat network.  
* Note:  'Simplified  approach'  to compliance  with standard  6.1 (build  to notional  building 
specifi cation,  no SAP compliance calculation needed)  is now removed as an option.  
* Clause  6.2.1 - Area-weighted average U-values  for elements  of fabric  improved;  one set of 
values now apply to all building work. Option of demonstrating compliance of new 
buildings  via 'space  heating demand  limit' set out. 
* Clause  6.2.5  - airtightness  testing  now undertaken on each  new dwelling.  No exception for 
high infiltration  dwellings.  Test methodology  refers to CIBSE  TM 23. 
* Clause  6.2.6 - reference now made  to fabric  values  in clause  6.2.1 for conversion  of heated

6.0.13  Certification  
Scottish Ministers can, under Section 7 of the Building (Scotland) Act 2003, approve 
schemes  for the certification  of design  or construction for compliance  with the mandatory 
functional standards. Such schemes are approved on the basis that the procedures adopted 
by the scheme will tak e account of the need to co-ordinate the work of various designers and 
specialist contractors. Individuals approved  to provide  certification services under the 
scheme are assessed to ensure that they have the qualifications, skills and experience 
required to certify compliance for the work covered by the scope of the scheme. Checking 
procedures adopted by Approved Certifiers will deliver design or installation reliability in 
accordance with  legislation.   
The Certification of Design (Sec tion 6 -  Energy) for Domestic Buildings scheme has been 
approved by Scottish Ministers to confirm compliance with Section 6. Details are available 
on the certificatio n pages  of the Building Standards Division website.

Page 431 Applicable from 5  June 2023  6.1 Energy  demand  and carbon  dioxide  emissions 
Mandatory Standard  
Standard 6.1  
Every building must be designed and constructed in such a way that:  
a) the energy performance is calculated in accordance with a methodology 
of calculation approved under regulation 7(a) of the Energy Performance 
of Buildings (Scotland) Regulations 2008;  
b) the energy performance of the building is capable of reducing carbon 
dioxide emissi ons;  
c) it is a nearly zero -energy building; and  
d) it is capable of reducing the energy demand of the building.  
Limitation:  
This standard does not apply to:  
a) alterations and extensions to buildings, other than:  
i. alterations and extensions to stand -alone buildings having an area 
less than 50 square metres that would increase the area to 50 square 
metres or more  
ii. extensions to non- domestic buildings where the extension will have 
an area which is both greater than 100 square metres and greater 
than 25% of the area of the existing building, and 
iii. alterations to buildings involving the fit -out of the building shell 
which is the subject of a continuing requirement  
b) conversions of buildings:  
c) non- domestic buildings and buildings that are ancillary to a dwe lling that 
are stand -alone having an area less than 50 square metres  
d) buildings, which will not be heated or cooled, other than by heating 
provided solely for the purpose of frost protection 
e) limited life buildings which have an intended life of less than 2 years.  
f) standard 6.1(b) only applies in respect of a building which is heated or 
cooled, or in which hot water is made available, by means of a direct 
emissions heating system.  
 
 
6.1.0  Introduction 
Standard 6.1 focuses on the reduction of energy demand and associated greenhouse gas 
emissions arising from the use of heating, hot water, lighting, ventilation and cooling 
systems in a new dwelling.  
################# - Page 432 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition   
 
Page 432 Applicable from 5  June 2023  The guidance which supports this standard sets a target for overall energy and emission 
performance in buildings by  use of a calculation methodology which assesses performance 
at a building level, considering a wide range of parameters which influence energy use.  
This means that, for new  dwellings, a designer is obliged to consider energy performance as 
a complete pac kage rather than looking only at individual elements such as insulation or 
heat generator efficiency - a 'whole dwelling approach' to energy, which offers a significant 
degree of design flexibility.  
For the majority of new buildings, Standard 6.1 has the greatest influence on design for 
energy performance, setting two challenging performance targets for both energy and 
building emissions which must both be met.  
Standards 6.2 to 6.6 recommend minimum performance levels to be achieved for individual 
elements or systems within a building. To achieve compliance with Standard 6.1, it will be 
necessary to improve upon some or all of these minimum levels or incorporate additional 
energy efficiency measures, such as generation of renewable heat or power to offset energy 
demand.  
Nearly zero energy buildings  
Initially  introduced in response  to a European  Directive,  "nearly  zero-energy  building"  means a 
building that has a very high energy performance, as determined in accordance with the 
methodology cited in this standard, where the 'nearly zero' or very low amount of energy 
required by the building should be covered, to a very significant extent, by energy from 
renewable sources,  produced  on site or nearby.  
Review of standards  in 2022  is the first improvement  since  this provision  was introduced  into 
regulation as part of standard 6.1 in March 2016. Standards now set, via the approved 
methodology and supporting guidance, should result in buildings with very low energy 
demand  at levels  which  are more  widely  associated  with the concept  of 'nearly  zero'.  
In this context, "energy from renewable sources" means energy from renewable non-fossil 
sources, namely wind, solar, aero- thermal, geothermal, hydrothermal and ocean energy, 
hydropower,  biomass,  landfill gas, sewage treatment  plant  gas and biogases.  In this context, 
current  and ongoing  decarbonisation  of grid electricity  is also now considered  to contribute as a 
renewable source,  as noted  in our draft Heat in Buildings  Strategy.  
High -efficiency alternative systems  
For all new buildings, it remains the case that the technical, environmental and economic 
feasibility of high -efficiency alternative systems (such as decentralised energy supply 
systems using renewable energy, co-generation, district or block heating/cooling and heat 
pumps are considered and taken into account in developing proposals. Further information 
on this process is provided in Annex 6.B -'Consideration of High -Efficiency Alternative 
Systems in New Buildings'.  
'Direct Emissions Heating Systems'  
It is proposed that, from 2024,  all new homes  will no longer  use 'direct  emissions  heating 
systems'.  
"direct emission heating system", in relation to a building, means a system (other than 
a heat network) by which the building is heated or is cooled, or by which hot water is 
made available in the building, which uses thermal energy produced by a source of

Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition   
 
Page 433 Applicable from 5  June 2023  a. is located within the building, or curtilage of the building, and  
b. during nor mal operation produces greenhouse gas emissions at the point of 
production of that thermal  energy".  
In advance of this change, from 2022, all new dwellings heated or cooled without use of direct  
emissions  heating systems (requiring combustion of fossil  or bio-fuels at an individual building  
level)  do not require to undertake a target  emissions  calculation  under  standard 6.1. 
Where the heat demand in a new dwelling is met using direct emissions heating systems, 
information must be provided to detail how a non-direct emission heat source can be 
retrofitted to the building. This should be both part of the building warrant application and be 
provided to the building owner as part of the written information required under standard 6.8.  
Conversions - in the case of conversions as specified in regulation 4, this standard does 
not apply.  
6.1.1  Dwellings  
Objective 1 -  the calculated greenhouse gas emissions for the proposed dwelling (the 
Dwelling Emissions Rate (DER) measured in kilograms of carbon dioxide (equi valent) per 
square metre of floor area per annum , kg.CO 2e/m2/yr) should be less than or equal to the 
Target Emissions Rate (TER) calculated for a 'notional dwelling' of the same size and shape.  
Objective 2 -  the calculated delivered energy demand for the proposed dwelling (the 
Dwelling Delivered Energy Rating (DDER) measured in kilowatt hours per square metre per 
year, kWh/m2/yr) should be less than or equal to the Target Delivered Energy Rate (TDER) 
calculated for a 'notional dwelling' of the same size and shape.  
Summary of procedure  
In order to establish the Target Emissions Rate (TER) and the Target Delivered Energy Rate 
(TDER) for the 'notional dwelling' (i.e. a dwelling of the same size, shape and 'living area 
fraction' as the proposed dwelling), the dimensions and 'living area fraction' of the proposed 
dwelling and a set of standard values are input into the methodology (see clause 6.1.2). To 
calculate the Dwelling Emissions Rate (DER) and Dwelling Delivered Energy Rate (DDER) for 
the proposed dwelling, a second calculation is carried out where the specification for the 
dwelling proposed by the applicant are input into the methodology.  
Exemption from TER/DER calculation  
Where there is no heat or cooling supplied to a new dwellin g from 'direct emissions heating 
systems' and all such sources are fuelled by electricity or thermal energy from a heat 
network, Standard 6.1(b) does not apply and the Target and Dwelling Emission Rate 
calculation need not be undertaken. The operation of the building is deemed to produce 'zero 
direct emissions'. Compliance with Standard 6.1 will still be demonstrated by the building 
meeting the Target Delivered Energy Rate (TDER).  
Standard Assessment Procedure (SAP)  
The Government's Standard Assessment Procedure for  Energy Rating of Dwellings (SAP 
10) is the calculation tool which forms part of the UK National Calculation Methodology and is 
the methodology for the calculation of energy and emissions performance of new dwellings 
approved under standard 6.1(a). At all stages, the conventions associated with the SAP 
document should be read in conjunction with the specific guidance given in the clauses to 
################# - Page 434 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition   
 
Page 434 Applicable from 5  June 2023  this section. Designers should be familiar with the SAP methodology and their chosen 
software tool and be able to explain the input and calculation process in the context of the 
information submitted as part of the building warrant.  
Non-domestic use within  dwellings  
Some new dwellings may incorporate surgeries, consulting rooms, offices or other 
accommodation of a floor area not exceeding 50 m2 in aggregate, used by an occupant of 
the dwelling in a professional or business capacity. Where this occurs, the accommodation 
should be considered as a part of the dwelling.  
6.1.2  Setting  the target  emissions  and delivered  energy  rates  
To set the target emissions and delivered energy rates, (i.e. the level that should not be 
exceeded, the TER/TDER), refer to the tabl e to this clause. The targets set are based on a 
specification linked to the choice of main heating type fuel. This specification is applied 
within the methodology to define a 'notional dwelling' having the same size, shape (including 
floor, roof, exposed wall areas and storey heights) and 'living area fraction' as the proposed 
dwelling. These terms are explained in SAP 10.  
Where the dwelling is to be served by an electric heat pump, one specification is defined. 
For any other heat solution at the building,  a second (mains gas) specification is defined. 
This is to provide a degree of equitability in performance outcomes for the heat pump 
systems that generally operate with a very high energy efficiency. Further adjustments are 
made to the second specification where the dwelling is supplied from a heat network, with 
the same heat network characteristics applied to both notional and actual building.  
Software vendors providing BRE approved SAP 10 software  will incorporate a function that, 
with purpose of assessment 'Scotland' selected, automatically generates the target rates 
once the choice of heating solution to the actual building, together with the 'notional 
dwelling' dimensions and 'living area  fraction' have  been input into the software.  
Measures to calculate target rates for the 'notional dwelling'  
The measures identified in the tables below a re set to deliver, on aggregate, a 32% 
reduction in emissions over application of the 2015 standards. Whilst a dwelling can be 
constructed using these packages of measures, it is stressed that the specifications are 
provided solely for the purpose of setti ng the targets (TER/TDER) for the 'notional' dwelling. 
Designers will find more cost -effective and relevant solution when considering the nature of 
the new home they propose.  
Accordingly, it is not necessary that values or elements present in these tables form part of 
the proposed dwelling. Designers are free to develop cost -effective and appropriate 
solutions which meet the TER and TDER, subject to meeting or improving upon the 
minimum levels identified in guidance to Standards 6.2 to 6.6.  
Low carbon equipment element of the TER/TDER (generation of power)  
The mains gas and heat network specification for the 'notional' building includes an element 
of low carbon equipment (LCE) represented, as a proxy, by the inclusion of roof mounted 
photovoltaic panels, expressed as a fixed percentage of the building gross internal area. This 
is included to assist in reducing the overall delivered energy total for the building and, 
accordingly, the associated emissions (where calculated).  
################# - Page 435 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition   
 
Page 435 Applicable from 5  June 2023  This PV elem ent is applied only to that portion of the actual building where space heating 
demand is not met by an electric heat pump. This is in recognition of the higher efficiency of 
heat pump solutions which will already significantly reduce the delivered energy total. 
Accordingly, a building where heat demand is met 100% by an electric heat pump will have 
no assigned PV in the notional building calculation.  
The incorporation of LCE within design proposals, is encouraged where this is considered 
an appropriate and cost-effective part of the overall building solution and the generating 
capacity can be shown to be utilised on site. From 2022, the calculation of notional and 
actual building will no longer include any component of generated power which is identified 
by SAP 10 as exported from the building. This change in approach seeks to reinforce the 
need for design choices to be effective in reducing the total delivered energy needed at a 
building, to the benefit of those using the building.

1. If there is a need to reduce the area of openings in the notional building to  25%:  
a. Include all opaque and semi -glazed doors with the same areas as the actual dwelling 
(excluding any doors not in exposed elements, e.g. entrance door to a flat from a 
heated corridor);  then 
b. Reduce area of all windows and roof windows/rooflights by a factor equal to [25% of 
total floor area less area of doors included in (a) above] divided by [total area of 
windows and roof windows/rooflights in actual  dwelling].  
2. Orientation same as actual dwelling. Over shading - average if actual dwelling has very 
little or average overshading; same as actual dwelling if greater  overshading.  
3. U-values for rooflights is already calculated on the horizontal  plane.  
4. For the purposes of setting the TER/TDER, a y-value of 0.05 is identified. Note that for 
DER/DDER, this element of calculati on must have the additional heat loss element (Htb) 
calculated from lengths of junctions and individual psi values.  
5. Three specifications are applied:  
a. if space heating is proposed via an electric heat pump, the notional building has a 
heat pump  solution;  
b. if any other heating solution is proposed, the notional building has a mains gas boiler 
solution (except see 6 below) and assignment of both photovoltaics and wastewater 
heat recovery. Where more than one fuel is used to heat different parts of t he building 
the calculation will assign each specification  based upon the proportion of each 
solution present by heated floor  area.  
6. Where heating is provided via a Heat Network connection, the notional building space 
and water heating efficiency is moderated downward to match the net efficiency of 'any 
other heating solution' (gas boiler).  This is to provide assurance that the efficie ncy of a 
supplied heat solution is represented in the same way as the efficiency of other (non-
heat pump) fuel solutions  in the actual building.  
7. The cited PV element of the specification is calculated on the basis of a panel 
specification of 6.5 m2/kWp. For purpose of calculating the benefit of the PV element in 
TER/TDER reporting, the contribution will be capped to the amount of generated energy 
that is assessed as not being exported from the dwelling, following the methodology set 
out in Appendix M1 of SAP 10. The same assessment  will be applied  to the DER/DDER 
calculation  - see clause 6.1.3.  
6.1.3  Calculating Dwelling Emissions  Rate  and Dwelling  Delivered 
Energy  Rates  
The second calculation established the Dwelling Emissions Rate (DER) and Dwelling 
Delivered Energy Rate (DDER) for the proposed dwelling. To do this the actual specification 
values proposed for the dwelling should be used in the methodology i.e. the U -values, air 
infiltration, heating system, etc.  
As noted in clause 6.1.2, wher e no heating or cooling is supplied to a new dwelling from 
'direct emissions heating systems', the Target and Dwelling Emission Rate calculation need 
not be undertaken.  
################# - Page 438 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition   
 
Page 438 Applicable from 5  June 2023  All values input should be dwelling- specific values and be for the location and orientation of 
the individual dwelling, as proposed. No standardised or default assumptions should be 
included. Before determining these values for input into the methodology, reference should 
be made to:  
* the maximum  space heating demand  or U-values  identified  in guidance to Standard 6.2, 
and 
* guidance on systems  and equipment  referenced in guidance to Standards  6.3 to 6.6 and 
the Domestic  Building  Services Compliance  Guide for Scotland.  
On-site generation of power -  export limitation 
As with the notional building calculation, the calculation of the performance of the actual 
building will assess the contribution of on- site generation of power and this will be capped to 
the amount of generated energy that is assessed as not exported from the dwelling, 
following the methodology set out in Appendix M1 of SAP 10. Where the calculated 
generating capacity exceeds that which is assessed as utilised on site, this excess will be 
reported to the designer. This capping is to intended provide assurance on the extent that 
such generation at a building is effective in reducing the delivered energy total for the 
dwelling . 
Demonstrating compliance for buildings with a supplied heat connection 
Compliance with standard 6.1 for a building supplied with heat from an external net work 
source will be demonstrated by the application of the heat network characteristics to both 
the actual building and the notional building (as noted in clause 6.1.2).  
This recognises that supplied heat can be utilised with 100% efficiency at the buildin g, with 
adjustment only needed to recognise any standing losses from heat interface units where 
not contributing usefully to reduce the heating demand at the building.  
Application of the same characteristics to both notional and actual building enables the 
designer to propose a supplied heat solution to an energy efficient new dwelling without the 
need to further compensate for the characteristics of the connected network. The 
improvement of the characteristics of heat from heat networks will be addressed t hrough 
separate regulation made under The Heat Networks (Scotland) Act 2021.  
Emissions and primary energy conversion  factors for  heat networks should be calculated to 
take account of the annual average performance of the whole system, including all 
distribution and heat generating characteristics and should be provided for the connecting 
network, from an assured source, by the network provider or from information registered in 
the SAP Product Characteristic Database. For network heat generation sources, the values in 
Table 12 of SAP 10 should be used. Whilst these factors are used to calculate emissions 
and primary energy totals for the actual dwelling, they are no longer applied as part of the 
process of demonstrating compliance with st andard 6.1 for new dwellings where all heating 
demand is met from a heat network.  
6.1.4  Buildings  with multiple  dwellings  
Where a building contains more than one dwelling (such as a block of flats or terrace of 
houses) the average emissions and delivered energy rate for the proposed block or terrace 
(DER and DDER) may be compared to the average target CO 2 emissions and delivered 
energy rate (TER and TDER) for the 'notional block or terrace'.  
################# - Page 439 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition   
 
Page 439 Applicable from 5  June 2023  The average rates for the block or terrace is the floor -area- weighted average for all the 
individual dwelling rates, i.e.:  
{(emissions 1 x floor area 1) + (emissions 2 x floor area 2) + (emissions 3 x floor area 3) + ...)} / 
{(floor area 1 + floor area 2 + floor area 3) + ...} 
The average Target Delivered Energy Rate should also be calculated using the formula above, 
replacing emissions total with energy totals.  
The degree of flexibility which is provided by averaging out building emissions and delivered 
energy should be used carefully. It is not intended that one or m ore dwellings are super -
insulated (in a building consisting of dwellings) so that another may be constructed with a 
high percentage of glazing. Designers should note that the option to use the 'space heating 
demand target' approach for building fabric desc ribed in clause 6.2.1 is applied at an 
individual dwelling level and may not be averaged across a block or terrace 
6.1.5 Heated  common  areas  in buildings  with multiple  dwellings  
Where the heated common areas in a domestic building are less than 50 m2 in total these 
rooms or areas may be treated as a small stand- alone building and are not therefore subject 
to Standard 6.1.  
Where subject to Standard 6.1, communal rooms or other areas in blocks of dwellings 
(which are exclusively associated with the dwellings)  should be assessed either by:  
a. a SBEM  calculation  using the methodology  and guidance to Standard 6.1 for non- 
domestic buildings,  or 
b. ensuring that the glazing does not exceed 25% of the total communal floor area of the 
building; and the actual building fabric and services specification is equal to or better 
than that given for the applicable notional dwelling specification set out in clause  6.1.2  
Note that an Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) will still be required, on completion of 
such areas, to meet Standard 6.9.  
6.1.6  Conservatories  and stand -alone  buildings  
Conservatories of less than 50 m2 in area are stand- alone buildings, thermally separated 
from the dwelling. A new dwelling to which one is attached should be ass essed as if there 
was no conservatory present.  
For conservatories and other ancillary stand- alone buildings of 50 m2 or more subject to 
Standard 6.1, a SBEM calculation using the methodology and guidance to Standard 6.1 for 
non-domestic buildings should be  provided, applying the standards set for domestic 
buildings in all other respects.

Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition   
 
Page 440 Applicable from 5  June 2023  6.2 Building insulation  envelope  
Mandatory Standard  
Standard 6.2  
Every building must be designed and constructed in such a way that an 
insulation envelope is provided which reduces heat loss.  
Limitation:  
This standard does not apply to:  
a) non- domestic buildings which will not be heated, other than heating 
provided solely for the purpose of frost  protection 
b) communal  parts of domestic buildings which will not be heated, other 
than heating provided solely for the purpose of frost protection,  or 
c) buildings which are ancillary to dwellings, other than conservatories, 
which are either unheated or provided with heating which is solely for the 
purpose of frost protection.  
 
 
6.2.0  Introduction 
The levels set out in the guidance to this standard are robust minimum values. These are 
needed for the following reasons:  
* to help reduce energy  demand  for space  heating,  particularly  in new dwellings,  where use 
of low carbon equipment (LCE) may reduce greenhouse gas emissions but not delivered 
energy consumption,  and 
* to ensure that a good  level of fabric  insulation is incorporated in building  work,  especially to 
construction  elements  which  would be difficult  or costly to upgrade in the future.  
Non-repeating thermal bridging at the junctions of building elements and around openings in 
the building envelope form part of the calculation of energy performance in the S tandard 
Assessment Procedure (SAP 10, see clause 6.1.1). Such junctions, if  poorly designed and 
constructed can contribute significantly to the overall heat loss through the insulation 
envelope.  
As fabric insulation levels improve, the rate at which heat i s lost through air infiltration 
through the building envelope (air permeability) becomes proportionally greater. When 
addressing infiltration, the provision of adequate, controllable ventilation is essential if both 
energy efficiency and good indoor air quality are to be achieved.  
Conversions - in the case of conversions, as specified in regulation 4, the building as 
converted shall meet the requirements of this standard in so far as is reasonably 
practicable, and in no case be worse than before the convers ion (regulation 12, schedule 6).  
 
 
################# - Page 441 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition   
 
Page 441 Applicable from 5  June 2023  6.2.1  Maximum  U-values for fabric  elements  of the building 
Where a balanced and practical approach is taken to reducing energy demand in new 
dwellings, a consistent and good level of fabric insulation will limit heat loss  through the 
building envelope.  
Table 6.2 below sets out robust minimum standards for the thermal performance of building 
elements in both new buildings and where undertaking the alteration, extension or 
conversion of existing buildings.  
Localised areas of  the same building element may be designed to give a poorer 
performance. These in turn will need to be compensated by the rest of the element  
being designed and built to a more demanding level. It is recommended that variation on the 
performance of element s be limited where practicable to enable a consistent level of 
reduction in heat loss throughout a dwelling and maintain continuity of insulation across 
elements and throughout accommodation.  
Any localised areas (individual elements) should have a U-value no worse than 0.7 (Walls and 
floors) or 0.35 (roofs).  Glazing with a U-value poorer than 3.3 should not be used. This is 
particularly important with regard to the control of surface and interstitial condensation (see 
Section 3:  Environment).  
To minimise such risks, designers should seek to specify and maintain individual element 
values significantly better than the above figures where practical to do so. Repeating 
thermal bridges (e.g. timber studs in a timber frame wall) need not be considered as an 
individual element in this respect, as these are already taken into account within a BS EN 
ISO 6946: 2017 U -value calculation.  
For communal areas refer also to clause 6.2.12.  
Table 6.2. Maximum U -values for building elements of the insulation envelope  
 
Type of element  Area -weighted average U-value (W/m2K)

Wall 1 0.17 
Floor 1 0.15 
Roof  0.12 
Windows and doors 2 1.4 
Rooflights 3 4 5 2.1 
Cavity separating wall  0.0 
Notes:  
1. Excluding separating walls and separating floors between heated areas where thermal 
transmittance need not be assessed, beyond measures to limit heat loss arising from air 
movement within any cavity separating wall. 
2. For windows and doors fitted to an exist ing building (one not subject to standard 6.1), an 
alternative to maximum U-value would be for the unit to have a Window Energy Rating or 
Doorset Energy Rating of B or better. Information on this rating system  is published by  
the Glass  and Glazing  Federation.  
################# - Page 442 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition   
 
Page 442 Applicable from 5  June 2023  3. U-value for rooflights is already calculated on the horizontal  plane.  
4. U-values for rooflights or rooflight -and-kerb assemblies should be based on the 
developed surface area of the rooflight (U d-values), which is often greater than the area 
of the roof opening. Further guidance on U d-values is given in the Building Research 
Establishment's BR 443  and the National Association of Rooflight Manufacturers' 
Technical Document NTD02.  
5. The limiting value for rooflights also applies to kerbs that are supplied as part of a single 
rooflight -and-kerb assembly sourced from the same supplier and for which the supplier 
can provide a combined U d-value for the assembly. An upstand built on site should not 
exceed the individual element  U-value of 0.35 . 
Cavity s eparating walls  
Unanticipated heat loss can arise via air movement, within a cavity separating wall, from 
heated areas to points outwith the insulation envelope. To limit heat loss, a separating wall 
cavity should have effective perimeter sealing around al l exposed edges and in line with 
insulation layers in abutting elements which separate the dwelling from another building or 
from an unheated space.  
Any cavity separating wall should also be fully filled with a material that limits air movement, 
allowing a  U-value of 0.0 to be assigned. In considering this issue, it is important that 
solutions also address the need to limit noise transmission (see Section 5: Noise).  
New dwellings - 'space heating demand limit' approach.  
For new buildings, meeting Standard 6.1 may result in even better levels of thermal 
insulation being achieved unless the design of a building involves improved specification of 
building services or greater effective use of on- site generation of heat or power.  
Effective limits to space heating  demand can be achieved by a consistently high level of fabric 
insulation, either by a specification no worse that the area weighted values listed in Table 6.2 
above or, where more design flexibility is sought, by demonstrating that the space heating 
deman d is no greater than a 'dwelling space heating demand limit' which is calculated for the 
notional building by replace the fabric values in table 6.1 with the values noted above.  
SAP 10 tools will report both the space heating demand for the actual dwelling and the 
'dwelling space heating demand limit' as part of calculated outputs.  
To provide assurance of thermal comfort for occupants, where the 'space heating demand 
target' is applied, this target must be met by each individual dwelling. Unlike the  DER and 
DDER (see clause 6.1.2), it may not be averaged across a block or  terrace.  
6.2.2  Areas  of windows,  doors  and rooflights  
Due to Standard 6.1, there is no need for guidance on minimum or maximum area for 
windows, doors and rooflights in new dwellings. The use of a methodology for establishing 
compliance with Standard 6.1 provides an equitable approach to balancing the issues of 
heat loss versus solar gain and natural lighting versus artificial lighting.  
In certain cases where there is a desir e to have a large proportion of glass it may be difficult 
to demonstrate compliance with Standard 6.1. In such cases, innovative solutions will need 
to be considered. All relevant standards and guidance should be considered, including the 
################# - Page 443 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition   
 
Page 443 Applicable from 5  June 2023  impact that large areas of glazing can have on summer overheating risk (see standard 
3.28).  
Guidance on alterations, extensions and conversions is provided in clauses 6.2.6 to 6.2.12. 
For communal areas, refer to clause 6.2.12.  
6.2.3  Limiting heat  loss through thermal  bridging 
As insulation values of new buildings improve, the need to limit heat loss through thermal 
bridging becomes increasingly important. Incorrect detailing at design stage or poor 
construction work can have a significant adverse effect on building perform ance.  
The insulation envelope of any heated building should be designed and constructed to limit 
heat loss through thermal bridging. The key areas of concern are:  
* repeating thermal  bridging  within  building  elements,  and 
* non-repeating  thermal  bridging  at the junction  between  building  elements  and at the edges  
of building  elements  where  openings  in the envelope are formed.  
Whilst repeating thermal bridges are taken into account in the BS EN ISO 6946: 2017 U - 
value calculation, a separate assessm ent of non- repeating thermal bridging should be 
carried out for new buildings which are subject to Standard 6.1. Advice and further 
information on assessment of the effects of thermal bridging can be found in BRE 
Information paper IP 1/06 -  'Assessing the effects of thermal bridging at junctions and 
around openings'.  
For new building work, the designer should demonstrate that the principles for reducing heat 
loss at junctions have been applied in the creation of the insulation envelope and the 
detailing of constructions, providing continuity of the insulation layer and of the air and 
vapour control layer.  
The SAP calculation tool referred to in the guidance to Standard 6.1 includes an assessment 
of heat loss arising from non-repeating thermal bridges in new dwellings. The overall heat loss 
is derived from numerical modelling of individual Ps (psi) values calculated in accordance with 
BS EN ISO 10211: 2017 'Thermal bridges in building construction  - heat flows  and surface 
temperatures  - detailed calculations'.  Guidance on this process is given in BR 497, 
'Conventions For Calculating Linear Thermal Transmittance and Temperature  Factors'.  
To determine the value for heat loss arising from non- repeating thermal bridging 
(transmission heat transfer coefficient or H tb) for the proposed dwelling, designers should 
identify the presence of those junctions listed in Appendix K of SAP 10  and assign Ps values 
to each junction, based upon the following options:  
a. input of default Ps values for each junction listed within Appendix K of SAP 10 
b. where  construction  of a junction  follows  published and substantiated construction  detail 
sets,  input  of Ps values  of the relevant junction(s)  from that document  
c. input of Ps values calculated by a person with suitable expertise and experience following 
the guidance set out in BR 497. 
Note that a combination of Ps  values from these sources can be used to produce a 
calculated heat loss.

sources of pre- calculated values can be found within introductory volume of the 'Accredited 
Construction Details (Scotland) 2022' . 
Note that, for 2022, no updated constructio n details are published by the Scottish 
Government. Reference should instead be made to recognised industry publications for 
independently calculated and validated examples.  
6.2.4  Limiting uncontrolled air infiltration 
Addressing infiltration  in new dwellings  can significantly  reduce heat loss and result  in lower 
carbon  dioxide  emissions.  This can provide flexibility  when applying the methodology  used to 
meet  the targets  for carbon dioxide emissions  and delivered  energy  (see Standard 6.1). 
To limit heat loss, any heated  building  should be designed to limit air infiltration  through  the 
building fabric. This is done by providing a continuous barrier that resists air movement 
through  the insulation  envelope and limits  external  air paths  into each  of the following:  
* the inside of the dwelling or building consisting of dwellings  
* the 'warm'  side of insulation layers  
* spaces  between  the component  parts  of exposed  building elements,  where such  parts 
contribute to the thermal  performance of the element.  
The infiltration rate used to set the target for emissions and delivered energy calculation is 
set out in Table 6. In clause 6.1.2. Whilst no minimum value is set for uncontrolled 
infiltration, it is recommended that buildings are designed to achieve a value of 7 
m3/(h.m2)@50Pa or better to allow a balanced approach to managing building heat loss. 
Where the designer specifies a higher infiltration rate they should set out their justification 
for this to the verifier.  
Due to the contribution of both detailing and workmanship, it remains difficult to achieve a 
specified air infiltration rate with any degree of accuracy. To ensure the dwelling will deliver 
the intended thermal performance without adversely affecting air quality, air tightness 
testing should be unde rtaken to verify as -built air infiltration rates (see clause 6.2.5).  
Limiting air infiltration to improve energy performance should not compromise ventilation 
required for:  
* the health of the occupants of the building (Section 3)  
* the removal of moisture fro m building fabric (Section 3)  
* the safe operation of combustion appliances (Section 3), and  
* any smoke  control system (Section 2).  
Lower air infiltration rates, of less than 5 m3/(h.m2)@50Pa, may give rise to problems with 
internal air quality and condensation unless this is addressed through an appropriate 
ventilation strategy which will commonly involve continuous mechanical extract ventilation. 
Reference should be made to recommended options for ventilation to mainta in indoor air 
quality under Standard 3.14.  
Similarly, work to improve an existing dwelling which includes measures which reduce 
infiltration  should  also consider  the impact  of such  work on condensation risk and moisture 
movement  within  affected  construction elements  (see clause 6.2.10).  
################# - Page 445 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition   
 
Page 445 Applicable from 5  June 2023  Common areas  
In building consisting of dwellings, common areas which need particular consideration to limit 
air infiltration  include  common stair entrances  and shafts  which  extend through  most  of the 
floors  (e.g. lift and common stair enclosures).  
6.2.5  Air-tightness  testing  
Low air infiltration rates will contribute to energy performance but should not be so low as to 
adversely affect the health of occupants or the building fabric as a consequence of a poorl y-
considered ventilation strategy. There is, therefore, a need to establish dwelling performance 
by test to provide assurance of compliance in both these respects.  
EPC data indicates that around one third of new dwellings have been subject to an air 
tightn ess test in recent years and are achieving an average air infiltration rate below 5 
m3/(h.m2)@50Pa. As this level of airtightness needs a different ventilation strategy than less 
airtight buildings, all new homes should be tested. This will provide greater assurance that 
the infiltration rate declared at the design stage is achieved on completion and that issues of 
both energy performance and ventilation are addressed.  
Air pressure tests should be performed following the methodology set out in CIBSE TM23: 
'Testing buildings for air leakage'.  
Testing should only be carried out by persons who can demonstrate relevant, recognised 
expertise in measuring the air permeability of buildings. This should include membership of 
a professional organisation which accredits its members as competent to test and confirm 
the results of testing.  
Further advice on these matters can be found in the BSD publication 'Sound and Air -
tightness Testing', 2022 Edition.  
6.2.6  Introducing  heating  to unheated   buildings  and conversion  of 
buildings  
A building that was originally designed to be unheated has, in most instances,  the greatest 
void to fill in terms of energy efficiency. The introduction of heating to such buildings will, if 
not accompanied by fabric insulation, result in disproportionate heat loss and wasteful use 
or fuel and power.  
In this context, existing buildi ngs where heating is provided solely for the purpose of frost 
protection (rated at a maximum of 25 W per m2 of floor area) shall be treated as unheated 
buildings.  
Where such a building, or part of a dwelling, is converted, or heating is introduced to a 
building that was previously designed to be unheated, the building should achieve a level of 
performance similar to that expected for new construction and follow the guidance in clause 
6.2.1.  
In the case of a building that was previously designed to be heated, the impact on energy 
efficiency as a result of the conversion will generally be less significant but the act of 
conversion should still trigger an assessment of the capacity to improve the building fabric 
and follow the guidance given in clause 6.2.1.  
################# - Page 446 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition   
 
Page 446 Applicable from 5  June 2023  In each case, the provisions set out in clause 6.2.1 should be met or, if not, evidence 
provided to demonstrate the extent to which an equivalent level of overall heat loss can be 
delivered to the extent that such work is reasonably practicable. Such evidenc e should 
clearly set out the options considered and the justification for the best values that the 
designer has arrived at, identifying any limitations arising from factors such as conflicting 
statutory requirements, lack of space, cost or issues of techni cal risk arising from the nature 
of the retained elements of building envelope.  
The total area of windows, doors and rooflights, should not exceed 25% of the floor area of 
the dwelling created by conversion. Alternatively, a compensatory approach should be 
taken.  
Conversion of part of a dwelling  
Examples  of work which  involve  conversion  of part of a dwelling  are; changing a roof space, an 
unheated garage or a deep solum space into an apartment or other habitable 
accommodation:  
* in the case  of a roof space,  this will usually  involve  extending  the insulation envelope to 
include,  the gables,  the collars,  a part of the rafters  and the oxters,  as well as any new or 
existing  dormer  construction.  The opportunity  should be taken  at this time to upgrade any 
remaining poorly performing parts of the roof which are immediately adjacent to the 
conversion,  for example,  insulation  to parts  of the ceiling  ties at the eaves  
* in the case  of an unheated  garage,  this will usually  involve  extending the insulation 
envelope to include,  the existing  floor,  perimeter  walls  and the roof/ceiling to the new 
habitable part,  and 
* in the case  of a deep solum  space,  this will usually  involve  extending the insulation 
envelope to include,  the solum/existing  floor and perimeter  walls  to the new habitable part.  
6.2.7  Conversion of historic,  listed  or traditional  buildings  
With historic, listed or traditional buildings, the energy efficiency improvement measures that 
should be invoked by conversion can be more complex.  
Whilst achieving the U -values recommended in clause 6.2.1 should remain the aim, a 
flexible approach to improvement should be taken, based upon investigation of the 
traditional construction, form and character of the buildin g in question and the applicability of 
improvement methods to that construction. Provisions under other legislation (e.g. planning 
consent for listed buildings or those within conservation areas, where there is a need to 
maintain character, form or features) are also relevant. The manner in which proposed 
improvements may affect moisture movement or the permeability of existing construction 
will also require assessment to address the risk of adverse consequences.  
For all buildings, it would be advisable to consider the feasibility of upgrading fabric to at 
least the U -values for individual elements noted in clause 6.2.1 (0.7 for walls and floors, 
0.35 for roofs and 3.3 for glazing). In many cases, specialist advice will be helpful in making 
an assessment to ensure that, in improving energy efficiency, there is no other, adverse 
effect to the building fabric.  
Accordingly, each building will have to be dealt with on its own merits. Improvements to the 
fabric insulation of the building will often depend on factors such as whether or not 
improvement work can be carried out in a non -disruptive manner without damaging existing 
################# - Page 447 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition   
 
Page 447 Applicable from 5  June 2023  fabric (for example, insulating the ceiling of an accessible roof space), or whether potential 
solutions are compatible with the existing con struction.  
In certain cases, buildings are given historic or listed status because of specific features 
present in certain parts of the building. In these circumstances, it may be possible to make 
greater improvements to other less sensitive areas.  
In all cases the 'do nothing' approach should not be considered initially. Innovative but 
sympathetic and practical solutions to energy efficiency, which are beyond the scope of this 
guidance, can often result in an alternative package of measures being developed for a 
building. For example, energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions can be reduced 
without affecting building fabric through improvements to the heating system (refer to 
Standards 6.3 and 6.4), the lighting system (refer to Standard 6.5) or incorporat ion of 
renewable heating or on- site generation of heat or power. Consultation on such matters at 
an early stage with both the verifier and the planning officer of the relevant authority is 
advised.  
Further guidance on issues that merit consideration and potential approaches to 
improvement can be found in the Historic Scotland Document 'Guide for Practitioners 6 - 
Conversion of Traditional Buildings'.  
6.2.8  Extensions  to the insulation  envelope  
Extension of a domestic building is not subject to Standard 6.1.  In view of this, measures to 
limit energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions rely primarily upon the performance of 
the new building fabric.  
As the majority of construction work for an extension will be new, there will seldom be the 
need to consider cons truction to a lesser specification as is sometimes the case for 
conversions and alterations. The exception to this is at the junction between existing and 
new, for example the need for proprietary metal 'wall starter' ties where the existing 
brickwork stop s and new cavity blockwork begins. However other building standards should 
still be met with regard to such transitional construction elements.  
Where the insulation envelope of a dwelling or a building consisting of dwellings is 
extended, the new building fabric should be designed in accordance with the maximum U - 
values set out in clause 6.2.1.  
To limit heat loss through openings, the area of windows, doors, and roof lights within an 
extension should be limited to 25% of the floor area of the extension plus the area  of any 
existing openings built over within the extensions. This may be exceeded where the 
compensatory approach (described below) is used to demonstrate that this results in no 
additional heat loss. 
Areas  of the same  building  element  may have a poorer  than average  performance provided the 
area-weighted  average U-value for all elements  of the same  type is maintained (e.g. by some 
elements having correspondingly better performance). To reduce the risk of condensation, the 
maximum individual element U-values should be no worse than the figures given in guidance 
clause  6.2.1.  
'Compensatory approach' using a notional extension  
A compensatory approach allows U -values for the elements involved in the work to be  
################# - Page 448 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition   
 
Page 448 Applicable from 5  June 2023  varied provided that the resulting overall heat loss for an extension is not greater than that 
of a 'notional' extension. The 'notional' extension should be the same size and shape as the 
proposed extension, and have the area weighted average U -values from the guidance to 
clause 6.2.1 and have an area of windows, doors and rooflights equal to 25% of the total 
extension floor area plus the area of built over openings.  
Examples of this approach are given in Annex 6.A.  
Whole dwelling approach  
Where SAP data is available for the existi ng dwelling, it may be practical to provide a 
revised SAP calculation to demonstrate compliance of a dwelling, as proposed, including 
extension, using the target -based methodology (DER not more than TER) set out in 
guidance to Standard 6.1 (carbon dioxide emissions). This option will generally only be 
viable where both extension and dwelling are built to the same, current edition of the 
standards.  
6.2.9  Thermal  bridging  and air infiltration for existing  buildings  
Where works to alter, extend or convert a building, the elements involved in the building 
work should follow the guidance in clauses 6.2.3 and 6.2.4 on limiting heat loss from 
thermal bridging and air infiltration and reference should be made to the principles set out in 
the introductory volume of t he BSD document ' Accredited Construction Details (Scotland) 
2022' . 
Calculation of heat loss from linear thermal bridging is not necessary unless the SAP 
methodology is being used to demonstrate compliance. Instead, as noted in clause 6.2.3, 
the designer should demonstrate that the principles for reducing heat loss at junctions have 
been applied i n the creation of the insulation envelope and the detailing of constructions, 
providing continuity of the insulation layer and of the air and vapour control layer.  
In addition, the recommendations within Building Research Establishment (BRE) Report 
262 'Thermal insulation: avoiding risks (2002 edition)' can be followed.  
6.2.10  Alterations  to the insulation  envelope  
For alterations it is more than likely that the existing construction will be from a different era, 
in building regulation terms. In many instances each building will need to be considered on 
its own merits. Some of the guidance given in this clause is written in specific terms, but in 
certain cases (e.g. historic, listed or traditional buildings), it may be necessary to adopt 
alternative energy efficiency measures which relate to the amount of alteration work being 
undertaken.  
Alterations that involve increasing the floor area and/or bringing parts of the existing building 
that were previously outwith the insulation envelope into the heated part of the dwelling are 
considered as extensions and/or conversions (regulation 4, schedule 2) and reference 
should be made to the relevant guidance clause for such work.  
For other alteration work, the extent to which improvement can be delivered will be affected 
by a range of issues, such as:  
* the form and construction of the existing envelope and the scope of works  
################# - Page 449 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition   
 
Page 449 Applicable from 5  June 2023  * the extent to which improvement is technically feasible without the risk of adverse 
consequences, and  
* the impact of any other statutory requir ements to which the building is subject (e.g. 
listing, conservation area).  
Alterations to the insulation envelope of a building should be considered using the guidance 
in the following paragraphs.  
Infill of small openings  
The infill of an existing opening of approximately 4 m 2 or less in the building fabric should 
have a U -value which matches at least that of the remainder of the surrounding element. In 
the case of a wall or floor however it should not be worse than 0.70 W/m 2K, and for a roof, 
not worse than 0.35 W/m 2K. 
Infill of large openings  
The infill of an existing opening of greater area (more than approximately 4 m 2) in the 
building fabric should have a U -value which achieves those in the table to clause 6.2.1. 
Another way would be to follow the guidance in the paragraph above, but compensate for 
the energy efficiency deficit by improving the overall U -value of other parts of the insulation 
envelope.  
Internal elements which become part of the insulation envelope  
Alteration can cause an existing internal element of a building to become part of the 
insulation envelope. This will most likely occur where a part of a building is permanently 
removed as a phase of the alteration work. Where this occurs, that part of the building 
(including any infill construct ion) should have U -values which achieve those in the table to 
clause 6.2.1. Another approach would be to follow the guidance given in the previous 
paragraph, but compensate for the energy efficiency deficit by improving the overall U -value 
of other parts o f the insulation envelope.  
However, where this occurs at a boundary, no upgrading need be carried out if the element 
is a wall that is exclusively the property of the adjoining building.  
Windows, doors and rooflights  
Where windows,  doors  and rooflights  are being created or replaced,  they should achieve the U-
value recommended in the table to clause  6.2.1.  
Where  the work relates  only to 1 or 2 replacement  windows  or doors,  to allow matching 
windows  or doors  be installed,  the frame  may be disregarded for assessment  purposes, 
provided that the centre pane U-value for each glazed unit is 1.2 W/m2K or less. For 
secondary  glazing,  an existing  window,  after alteration  should achieve  a U-value  of about 3.5 
W/m2K. 
Areas of windows, doors and roofl ights  
Where additional windows, doors and rooflights are being created, the total area (including 
existing) of these elements should not exceed 25% of the total dwelling floor area. In the 
case of a heated communal room or other area (exclusively associated with the dwellings), 
it should not exceed 25% of the total floor area of these rooms/areas.  
Alternatively, the designer should show that the work to provide additional glazing will not 
result in an increase in the overall heat loss in the dwelling.  
################# - Page 450 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition   
 
Page 450 Applicable from 5  June 2023  Recon struction of elements  
Where the build-up of an element  forming  part of the insulation  envelope is to be altered or 
dismantled and rebuilt, the opportunity should be taken to improve the level of thermal 
insulation.  
The table  to clause  6.2.1  gives benchmark  U-values and in many  cases  these  can be achieved,  
without  technical  risk, within  the constraints  of the existing  construction.  It is recognised  
however  certain constructions  are easier  to upgrade than others  and these values should be 
met as far as is reasonably practicable.  
A building  that was in a ruinous  state  should,  after renovation,  be able to achieve almost  the 
level expected of new construction. It may not however be reasonably practicable for a 
dwelling,  which  is in a habitable condition,  to have its internal  space  significantly  reduced  in 
area or height in order to accommodate insulation; or for excessive enabling alterations to be 
caused by the fitting of external thermal insulation, unless the owner/occupier of the dwelling 
intends that these changes are to be made. Other building standards and the impact  that they 
will have when upgrading thermal  insulation  should be taken  into account.  
In the majority  of cases  however,  after an alteration of this nature to the insulation  envelope, a 
roof should be able to achieve  at least  an average U-value  of 0.35 W/m2K and in the case of a 
wall or floor, 0.70 W/m2K. 
For older buildings of traditional construction, further guidance to assist in this assessment 
can be found in the Historic Scotland Document 'Guide for Practitioners 6 -  Conversion of 
Traditional Buildings'.  
Thermal bridging and air infiltration 
When alterations are carried out, attention should still be paid to limiting thermal  bridging at 
junctions and around windows, doors and rooflights and limiting air infiltration (clause 6.2.9). 
However, only the work that forms the alteration and the impact of that work on the existing 
building need be considered.  
6.2.11  Conservatories  
Conservatories are a common addition to many dwellings. Traditionally used as an ancillary 
space, occupied for part of the year, conservatories are now often used year -round leading 
to an increased heating demand. Accordingly, such buildings should, like other heated 
stand- alone buildings, be constructed to limit energy demand and reduce CO 2 emissions.  
Some smaller conservatories can be exempt from both building warrant and building 
standards (see Section 0). Conservatories of 50 m 2 or more ar e subject to Standard 6.1 
(see clause 6.1.6).  
Thermal division  
A conservatory should be thermally divided from a dwelling, being outwith the insulation 
envelope of the dwelling. The dividing elements (e.g. wall, door, and window) should have 
U-values equal  or better than the corresponding exposed elements in the rest of the 
dwelling.  
U-values  
Although conservatories are attached to dwellings, they are stand- alone buildings. Where 
not exempt, a conservatory (heated or unheated) should be built to the same maximum U - 
################# - Page 451 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition   
 
Page 451 Applicable from 5  June 2023  values as any other new work, as listed in the table in clause 6.2.1. The exception is that 
glazing and framing elements forming the walls or roof of a conservatory are unlimited in 
area and should have a maximum area- weighted average U -value of 1.8 W/m 2K and a 
maximum individual element U -value of 3.3 W/m2K.  
U-values of glazing elements forming the roof are usually quoted in the vertical plane and 
should therefore be adjusted allowing for the angle of the roof. Further guidance and U - 
value adjust ments can be found in BR 443: 2019 'Conventions for U -value calculations'.  
Thermal bridging and air infiltration 
In order to limit air infiltration and thermal bridging at junctions and around windows, doors 
and rooflights, guidance in clause 6.2.9 should be followed.  
If using the Building Standards Division document: 'Conservatories' , these issues will be 
considered to have been taken into account. Draught stripping for existing windows and 
doors which are part of the thermal division between the conservatory and the dwelling 
should be of a similar standard as the exposed windows and doors elsewhere in the 
dwelling.  
6.2.12  Stand -alone buildings  
Thermal division of a stand- alone building from the remainder of a dwelling or domestic 
building is explained in clause 6.2.11.  
For heated stand- alone buildings of less than 50 m 2, the fabric values identified in the table 
to clause 6.2.1. U -value recommendations should be met, though it should be noted that the 
area of glazing is not limited. This allows, for example, a dwelling to be extended to create a 
highly -glazed stand- alone building such as a sunroom, w ith glazing in excess of the limits 
identified in clause 6.2.8.  
Stand -alone buildings of 50 m 2 or more are subject to Standard 6.1. Reference should be 
made to clause 6.1.6 and use of the non- domestic calculation methodology to assess 
carbon dioxide emissi ons. 
Common areas  
Where the total area of a communal room or other heated accommodation associated with 
a block of dwellings is less than 50 m2, these rooms or accommodation should also be 
treated as a stand- alone building. Elements (including dividing ele ments) should have U -
values equal to or better than those chosen for the rest of the building, as determined in 
conjunction with the methodology in Standard 6.1. As part of a new building, the area of 
windows, doors, rooflights and roof windows in these ro oms or accommodation should be 
limited to 25% of the total floor area of these common areas.

Mandatory Standard  
Standard 6.3  
Every building must be designed and constructed in such a way that the  
heating and hot water service systems installed are energy efficient and are 
capable of being controlled to achieve optimum energy efficiency; and  
Limitation:  
This standard does not apply to:  
a) buildings which do not use fuel or power for controlling the temperature 
of the internal environment,  or 
b) heating provided solely for the purpose of frost protection.  
 
 
6.3.0  Introduction 
In the design of domestic buildings, the energy efficiency of the heating plant is an important 
part of the packag e of measures which contributes to the overall dwelling energy and 
emissions performance. In practice the backstop levels given in this guidance for appliance 
efficiencies and controls will normally be exceeded to achieve compliance with Standard 6.1 
for new buildings. The notional dwelling standard specifications already indicate this (refer 
to clause 6.1.2).  
This guidance refers to main heating systems for dwellings. Both the primary heating and 
secondary heating systems are taken account of in SAP 10.  
'Direct emissions heating systems'  
It is proposed that, from 2024, all new dwellings will no longer be heated with 'direct 
emission heating systems'. In advance of this change, where the heat demand in a new 
dwelling is met using direct emissions heating sys tems, information must be provided to 
detail how a non- direct emission heat source can be retrofitted to the building. Such 
information is necessary to support a simple and cost -effective transition from such heat 
solutions in the future. This information should be both part of the building warrant 
application and be provided to the building owner as part of the written information required 
under standard 6.8.  
Conversions  - in the case of conversions, as specified in regulation 4, the building as 
converted shall meet the requirements of this standard in so far as is reasonably 
practicable, and in no case be worse than before the conversion (regulation 12, schedule 6).  
6.3.1  Performance of fixed  heating  systems  in new and existing buildings  
The minimum performance of, space heating and hot water systems, heating appliances 
and controls is set out in the Domestic Buildin g Services Compliance Guide for Scotland . 
################# - Page 453 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition   
 
Page 453 Applicable from 5  June 2023  The document replicates guidance published in support of building standards elsewhere in 
the UK and supports standardisation of the specification and expected performance of fixed 
building services throughout the UK. The guidance applies to new systems and 
replacement, in whole or in part, of existing systems. It also addresses improvement work to 
existing systems as a consequence of replacing components.  
Historic, listed or tradit ional buildings  
In many cases heating system improvements to historic, listed or traditional buildings will be 
more feasible than other energy efficiency measures such as improving wall insulation.  
Where this is the case, systems which go beyond these mini mum backstop levels may help 
offset the deficiency in other areas of energy efficiency and carbon dioxide emissions.  
Conservatories  
As a conservatory which is heated will be inefficient in energy terms, the general guidance 
to occupiers is that they should be heated as little as possible. In view of the fact that 
heating is often desired particularly at the start and end of the heating season, any 
conservatory with heating installed should have controls that regulate it from the rest of the 
dwelling e.g. a thermostatic radiator valve (TRV) to each radiator.

Standard 6.4  
Every building must be designed and constructed in such a way that 
temperature loss from heated pipes, ducts and vessels, and temperature gain to

Limitation:  
This standard does not apply to:  
a) buildings which do not use fuel or power for heating or cooling either 
the internal environment or water  services  
b) buildings, or parts of a building, which will not be heated, other than 
heating provided solely for the purpose of frost protection,  or 
c) pipes, ducts or vessels that form part of an isolated industrial or 
commercial process.  
 
 
6.4.0  Introduction 
Thermal insulation to heating pipes and ducts and hot water storage vessels will improve 
energy efficiency by preventing:  
* uncontrolled heat loss or heat gains from such equipment, and  
* an uncontrolled rise in the temperature of the parts of the building where such 
equipment is situated.  
Conversions  - in the case of conversions, as specified in regulation 4, the building as 
converted shall meet the requirements of this standard as is reasonably practicable, and in 
no case be worse than before the conversion (regulation 12, schedule 6).  
6.4.1  Insulation  of pipes,  ducts  and vessels in new and existing 
buildings  
Guidance on the insulation of pipes, ducts and vessels is set out, in the context of the 
systems of which they form a part, in section 9 of the Domestic Building Services 
Compliance Guide for Scotland . 
The document replicates guidance published in support of building standards elsewhere in 
the UK and supports standardisation of the specification and expected performance of 
fixed building services throughout the UK. The guidance applies to new systems and 
replacement, in whole or in part, of existing systems. It also addresses improvement work 
to existing systems as a consequence of replacing components.

Mandatory Standard  
Standard 6.5  
Every building must be designed and constructed in such a way that the 
artificial or display lighting installed is energy efficient and is capable of being 
controlled to achieve opti mum energy efficiency.  
Limitation:  
This standard does not apply to:  
a) process and emergency lighting components in a building,  or 
b) alterations in dwellings or a building ancillary to a dwelling. 
 
 
6.5.0  Introduction 
Artificial lighting can account for a substantial proportion of the electricity used within a 
building. Appropriate lighting design (including use of natural daylight) can reduce energy 
demand, emissions and running costs.  
A limit for energy use arising from fixed lighting is included in the n otional building 
specification for new dwellings under standard 6.1. Lighting in all buildings should be 
provided to meet the needs of occupants based upon the activities undertaken in different 
areas of the dwelling.  
Conversions  - in the case of conversions, as specified in regulation 4, the building as 
converted shall meet the requirements of this standard in so far as is reasonably 
practicable, and in no case be worse than before the conversion (regulation 12, schedule 
6). 
6.5.1 Fixed  lighting 
Guidance o n the efficiency of fixed internal and external lighting is given in section 13 of 
the Domestic Building Services Compliance Guide for Scotland . 
The document replicates guidance published in support of building standards elsewhere in 
the UK and supports standardisation of the specification and expected performance of 
fixed building services throughout the UK. The guidance applies to new systems and 
replacement, in whole or in part, of existing systems. It also addresses improvement work 
to existing systems as a consequence of replacing components.  
Common Areas of domestic buildings  - lighting levels a nd controls to enable the safe 
use of lighting in common areas such as corridors, stairs and other circulation areas, are 
identified in clause 4.6.2 within Section 4.

Page 456 Applicable from 5  June 2023  6.6 Mechanical  ventilation and air conditioning  
Mandatory Standard  
Standard 6.6  
Every building must be designed and constructed in such a way that:  
a) the form  and fabric  of the building minimises  the use of mechanical 
ventilating or cooling systems for cooling purposes,  and 
b) ventilating  and cooling systems  installed  are energy  efficient  and are 
capable of being controlled to achieve optimum  energy  efficiency.  
Limitation:  
This standard does not apply to buildings which do not use fuel or power for 
ventilating or cooling the internal environment.  
 
 
6.6.0  Introduction 
It is not desirable that dwellings or buildings consisting of dwellings have air -conditioning 
systems or use mechanical ventilation systems for cooling purposes, as this leads to 
increased energy use and higher greenhouse gas emissions. In view of this, guidance is 
intended to promote designs that avoid the need for such systems in dwellings, including 
an assessment of summertime overheating risk set out in standard 3.28 and advice to 
standard 3.14 on ventilation in certain dwelling types with limited facility for cr oss-
ventilation.  However, where such systems are installed, which should generally only be a 
consideration when working with existing buildings, a performance specification to limit 
energy use is set out.  
With the drive to reduce greenhouse gas emissions a nd limit energy demand in buildings, 
the need arises to consider efficient use of mechanical systems, including ventilation. 
Accordingly, guidance is now offered on power consumption and controls of such systems 
and on the efficiency of systems that incorporate heat recovery.  
Conversions  - in the case of conversions, as specified in regulation 4, the building as 
converted shall meet the requirement of this standard in so far as is reasonably 
practicable, and in no case be worse than before the conversion (r egulation 12, schedule 
6). 
6.6.1  Form  and fabric of the building 
Reduce overheating  
In order to minimise any need for mechanical ventilation for cooling or air -conditioning due 
to high internal temperatures in hot weather the following issues should be considered with 
regard to the form and the fabric of the dwelling:  
* proportion of translucent glazing taking into account the need for natural light in 
apartments (Standard 3.16) and artificial lighting (Standard 6.5)  
* orientation of translucent glazed areas  
################# - Page 457 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition   
 
Page 457 Applicable from 5  June 2023  * solar shading or other solar control measures where areas of the external building 
fabric are susceptible to solar gain  
* natural ventilation (including night cooling), and  
* thermal mass.  
Where a dwelling has little or no cross ventilation (e.g. flats with all external 
windows/rooflights on one southerly elevation which is orientated between due east and 
due west) or a high proportion of translucent glazing, the risk of summer overheating is 
increased.  
Provisions for the first four of these elements are addresse d in more detail under standard 
3.28 in the assessment and mitigation of summer overheating risk.  
Cooling system  
A mechanical cooling system should only be considered for a dwelling where the designer 
has first demonstrate that all reasonable measures have been taken to limit high internal 
temperatures. Refer to assessment under standard 3.28.  
* For new dwellings, mitigation through passive measures should be achieved.  
* For conversions and existing buildings, it is recognised that limitations arising from the 
building form and fabric may preclude an effective passive solution that fully mitigates 
risk. 
6.6.2  Efficiency of mechanical  ventilation  and air conditioning systems  
in new and existing  buildings  
Guidance on the efficiency of mechanical ventilation and ai r conditioning systems is given 
in sections 10 and 11 of the Domestic Building Services Compliance Guide for Scotland . 
The document replicates guidance publis hed in support of building standards elsewhere in 
the UK and supports standardisation of the specification and expected performance of 
fixed building services throughout the UK. The guidance applies to new systems and 
replacement, in whole or in part, of existing systems. It also addresses improvement work 
to existing systems as a consequence of replacing components.  
Clause 6.6.3 provides information on situations not addressed in that document.  
6.6.3  Design  and installation of Ductwork  
The design and installation of ductwork design can have a significant effect on the 
effectiveness of a ventilation system. Further guidance on basic good practice in 
installation and commissioning of ventilation systems can be found in guidance to 
Standard 3.14 and Annex 3.A.

Page 458 Applicable from 5  June 2023  6.7 Commissioning buildin g services  
Mandatory Standard  
Standard 6.7  
Every building must be designed and constructed in such a way that energy 
supply systems, control systems and building services which use fuel or power 
for heating, lighting, ventilating and cooling the internal environment and 
heating the water, are commissioned to achieve effective operation and 
optimum energy efficiency.  
Limitation:  
This standard does not apply to:  
a) major power plants serving the National  Grid 
b) the process and  emergency lighting components of a  building  
c) heating provided solely for the purpose of frost protection,  or 
d) energy supply systems used solely for industrial and commercial 
processes, leisure use and emergency use within a building.  
 
 
6.7.0  Introduction 
Commissioning in terms of this section means, raising the building services systems 
covered by this guidance from a level of static completion to full working order and 
achieving the levels of energy efficiency that the component manufacturers  expect from 
their product(s). Commissioning however, should also be carried out with a view to 
enabling the safe operation of the installation.  
Although there is no requirement within Section 6 for minimum efficiency levels of either, 
building- integrated or localised energy supply systems (e.g. diesel generators, micro wind 
turbines or photovoltaic arrays), there is a need for commissioning to be carried out to 
enable efficient use, unless they are exempt under schedule 1, regulation 3. Power plants 
which serve a number of buildings (e.g. housing estates) and only export surplus electricity 
to the National Grid will also need to be commissioned, unless exempt in terms of 
schedule 1, regulation 3.  
Conversions - in the case of conversions, as specified in reg ulation 4, the building as 
converted shall meet the requirement of this standard (regulation 12, schedule 6).  
6.7.1  Inspection  and commissioning 
All heating, hot water service, ventilating or cooling systems, control systems and any 
decentralised equipment for power generation in a dwelling or other area of a building 
consisting of dwellings should be inspected and commissioned in accordance with 
manufacturers' instructions to enable optimum energy efficiency.  
Guidance and supplementary information to assist the commissioning of installed building 
services is given in the Domestic Building Services Compliance Gui de for Scotland . The 
################# - Page 459 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition   
 
Page 459 Applicable from 5  June 2023  document is intended to support standardisation of the specification and expected 
performance of fixed building services throughout the UK. The guidance applies to new 
and replacement systems and com ponents.  
6.7.2  Commissioning Plan at design  stage 
A schedule of proposed building systems should be provided as part of the building 
warrant application, setting out the following:  
* the systems to test and the nature of commissioning tests applied;  
* a schedule of commissioning tests and who will undertake them; and  
* The documentation which will be provided as an output from commissioning.  
6.7.3  Commissioning  Report  on completion  of construction  
On completion of building works, a document setting out the commissioning undertaken, 
including any changes made to the original design, should be provided to the verifier.  
This should record the actions taken to complete the design stage commissioning plan, 
confirming all services listed were commissioned and pres ent the output from the 
commissioning work, confirming successful commissioning and operation of systems in 
accordance with the specified design intent. Any issues encountered and actions taken to 
rectify them should also be recorded.  
A copy of this commissioning report should be appended to the information provided under 
standard 6.8.

Page 460 Applicable from 5  June 2023  6.8 Written  information  
Mandatory Standard  
Standard 6.8  
The occupiers of a building must be provided with written information by the 
owner:  
a) on the operation and maintenance  of the building services and energy 
supply systems;  and 
b) where  any air-conditioning system  in the building is subject  to 
regulation 17, stating a time -based interval for inspection of the  system.  
Limitation:  
This standard does not apply to:  
a) major power plants serving the National  Grid 
b) buildings which do not use fuel or power for heating, lighting, ventilating 
and cooling the internal environment and heating the water supply  
services 
c) the process and emergency lighting components of a  building  
d) heating provided solely for the purpose of frost  protection  
e) lighting systems in a domestic building,  or 
f) energy supply systems used solely for industrial and commercial  
processes, leisure use and emergency use within a  building.  
 
 
6.8.0  Introduction 
Correct use and maintenance of building services equipment is essential if the benefits of 
enhanced energy efficiency are to be realised from such equipment. The intention of this 
standard is to make the information that will help achieve this  available to the occupier of 
the building.  
Although there is no requirement within Section 6 for minimum efficiency levels of either, 
building- integrated or localised energy supply systems (e.g. diesel generators, micro wind 
turbines or photovoltaic array s), there is a need for user and maintenance instructions to 
enable efficient use, unless they are exempt under schedule 1, regulation 3.  
Power plants which serve a number of buildings (e.g. housing estates) and only export 
surplus electricity to the Natio nal Grid will also need to have user and maintenance 
instructions, unless exempt in terms of schedule 1, regulation 3.  
From 2024, new dwellings will be required to no longer use 'direct emissions heating 
systems'. There is a similar intent for the for depl oyment of low and zero emissions heat 
within our existing building stock. To assist building owners understand what this will 
entail, information should be provided which sets out such future replacement work where 
a new building has a direct emission heat ing source. For most buildings, it is expected that 
################# - Page 461 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition   
 
Page 461 Applicable from 5  June 2023  information on the practical implementation of such an option at the point of initial 
construction would be developed as part of considering the use of 'high-  efficiency 
alternative systems' . 
Conversions  - in the case of conversions, as specified in regulation 4, the building as 
converted shall meet the requirement of this standard (regulation 12, schedule 6).  
6.8.1  Written  information 
Written information should be made available for the use of the occupier on the operation 
and maintenance of the heating, ventilation, cooling and hot water service system, any 
additional low carbon equipment installations and any decentralised equipment for power 
generation to encourage optimum energy efficiency. If an air c onditioning system is 
installed in a dwelling the guidance to regulation 17 should be followed.  
6.8.2  Quick Start  Guide  
In addition to comprehensive information provided under clause 6.8.1, a quick start guide, 
identifying all installed building services, the location of controls and identifying how 
systems should be used for optimum efficiency should be provided for each new dwelling. 
Further information and an example of such a guide can be found within Section 7 
(Sustainability) - refer to Annex 7.B.  
The quick start guide should include a copy of the information noted in guidance to 
standard 3.28 on mitigating measures to reduce overheating within the building.  
6.8.3  Information  to enable future  retrofit  of zero  direct  emissions 
heating  
Where a new building is constructed with a direct emission heating system which meets all 
or part of heating or cooling needs, the occupier shall be provided with information that 
sets out the process and work involved to deliver the future installation of a non-  direct 
emissions heat source, simply and without disruption beyond the immediate vicinity of the 
current heat source.  
In this respect, where the current heat source is a combustion appliance (boiler), 
information on a zero direct emission replacement heat sour ce shall include a solution in 
addition to any information on the direct replacement of the combustion appliance with an 
electric boiler.  
The information provided shall include, but not be limited to:  
* A specification which defines or would enable selection of a new heat source based 
upon the current calculated space heating and hot water demand and heat distribution 
system.  
* Confirmation of the location of any elements needed in addition to the new heat source 
to enable its operation and that these have been provided for in the initial design and 
layout of the dwelling.  
* Confirmation of the designed and installed heat distribution system and its 
compatibility with the proposed alternative heat source, without physical modification, 
and the required operational  characteristics of the new heat source in this respect.  
################# - Page 462 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition   
 
Page 462 Applicable from 5  June 2023  * Other information sufficient to enable a quotation for such a replacement heat source 
to be sought from an installer.  
* Written advice on the impact of the suggested replacement heat source on the ener gy 
and emission performance of the building and the comparative running costs for 
heating and hot water (this may be drawn from SAP data).  
* This information shall be appended to the Quick Start Guide noted in clause 6.8.2 
under the title 'Retrofit of your existing heating system to 'zero direct emissions' heat".  
6.8.4  Work  on existing  buildings  
Where alterations are carried out to building services on a piecemeal basis, the alterations 
may not result in optimum energy efficiency being attained for the whole system. In this 
case a list of recommendations which would improve the overall energy efficiency of the 
system should be provided.

Mandatory Standard  
Standard 6.9  
Every building must be designed and constructed i n such a way that:  
a) an energy performance certificate for the building is affixed to the 
building; and  
b) the energy performance certificate is displayed in a prominent place 
within the building.  
Limitation:  
a) This standard does not apply to:  
i. buildings which do not use fuel or power for controlling the 
temperature of the internal environment  
ii. non- domestic buildings and buildings that are ancillary to a dwelling 
that are stand alone having an area less than 50 square metres 
iii. conversions, alterations and extensions t o buildings other than -  
(aa) alterations and extensions to stand -alone buildings having an area 
less than 50 square metres that would increase the area to 50 
square metres or more, and  
(bb) alterations to buildings involving the fit -out of the building shell 
which is the subject of a continuing requirement, or  
iv. limited life buildings which have an intended life of less than 2 
years.  
b) Standard 6.9(b) only applies to buildings:  
i. with a floor area of more than 250 square metres  
ii. into which members of the public have an express or implied 
licence to enter, and  
iii. which are visited by members of the public on at least a weekly 
basis  
 
 
6.9.0  Introduction 
A requirement for the production of an Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) on 
completion of m ost new buildings was introduce in response to Article 12 of the EU Energy 
Performance of Buildings Directive in 2007. EPCs provide an established means of 
reporting on building energy performance  and are  an essential element in our ongoing 
Heat in Build ings Strategy, with review of their format and application programmed over 
the coming years.  
################# - Page 464 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition   
 
Page 464 Applicable from 5  June 2023  Standard 6.9 ensures the continued presence of such information for buyers and tenants 
by also making EPCs fixtures within new buildings.  
EPCs must be produced in an independent manner and be carried out by qualified/  
accredited experts. Since January 2013, EPCs must be produced by members of an 
Approved Organisation. Scottish Ministers have appointed a number of Approved 
Organisations (AO) to deliver certification services, with each AO following an Operating 
Framework which is published on the Scottish Government website. Information on this 
framework and Approved Organisations can be found at http://www.scotland.gov.uk/epc .  
All EPCs produced for new dwellings are lodge on the Scottish EPC Register . 
Scottish Ministers have directed local authorit ies to apply Standard 6.9 (a) to existing 
buildings using Section 25 (2) of the Building (Scotland) Act 2003. The direction limits the 
description of the buildings to which this standard applies to those that are being sold or 
rented out, in support of dut ies imposed by The Energy Performance of Buildings 
(Scotland) Regulations 2008.  
Definitions  
In application of this standard 'energy performance certificate' has the same meaning as 
given in The Energy Performance of Buildings (Scotland) Regulations 2008.  
Conversions  - in the case of conversions, as specified in regulation 4 Standard 6.9 does 
not apply.  
6.9.1  Calculating  the carbon dioxide  emissions for a certificate  
For any new building subject to this standard, the information needed to generate an 
Energy Performance Certificate is present in the compliance calculation undertaken in 
support of standard 6.1.  
For the purpose of establishing a rating for the energy performance certificate for a new 
dwelling, the values and specifications used to obtain building warrant (as varied by any 
subsequent amendments to warrant) should be adopted. The information should represent 
the completed dwelling, as built, and should therefore include no default assumptions or 
standardised elements.  Note that the calculati on undertaken for an EPC differs from that 
used to demonstrate compliance with standard 6.1 (on- site generation of power is fully 
reported and heat network characteristics are applied).  
Non-domestic use within dwellings  - accommodation up to 50 m 2 used by  an occupant 
of a dwelling in their professional or business capacity should be considered as a part of 
the dwelling and such accommodation certified as such.  
6.9.2  Information to be provided for buildings  
The energy performance certificate  must display th e following information:  
* the postal  address  of the building  for which  the certificate  is issued  
* a unique reference number  
* the date of the assessment  
* the date of the certificate  
* the dwelling type 
################# - Page 465 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition   
 
Page 465 Applicable from 5  June 2023  * the type of assessment  used  for certification  
* the conditioned  floor area of the building  
* the main  heating  and fuel type 
* a primary energy  indicator  
* the current and potential energy efficiency rating expressed on seven band scale 
representing the following bands  of running costs;  A, B, C, D, E, F and G, where  A = 
excellent and G = very  poor 
* the current  and potential  environmental  impact  rating  expressed on a seven  band  scale 
representing the following  bands  of carbon dioxide  emissions;  A, B, C, D, E, F and G, 
where A = excellent  and G = very poor 
* a list of the top applicable  recommendations  for cost-effective  improvements  
* a statement  indicating  that more  detailed  information on the recommendations  made  in 
the EPC  is contained in the recommendations  report,  and 
* a statement  to the effect that the EPC must  be affixed  to the building  and not to be 
removed unless  it is replaced with an updated  version.  
* The recommendations report, which must accompany the EPC, but which does not 
have to be affixed to the building, includes the following additional information:  
* a summary  of the energy  performance related  features  of the dwelling  
* estimated  energy costs  (based upon  standard use patterns),  and 
* a list of all improvements  identified for the dwelling  and further  information on each 
measure.  
Cost -effective improvement  - there are cost -effective, low -cost, energy efficiency 
improvements that can be made to most dwellings (when no other work is proposed) such 
as upgrade insulation in an accessible roof space or fit low energy lamps throughout the 
dwelling. Measures presented on the certificate and recommendations report must meet 
Scottish building regulations, relevant to the individual dwelling and should be technically 
feasible.  
The recommendations report may give additional advice on protected energy costs and 
improvem ents that are cost -effective only when additional work is being carried out e.g. 
providing insulation when replacing flat roof coverings.  
Some experts providing certificates may wish to add extra value and give additional advice 
to their clients. All of th is is welcome, but in every case, such information should be clearly 
explained in the addendum section of the recommendations report and be accompanied 
by advice on relevant warrants and building regulations. Sources of further energy saving 
advice and fun ding options are also noted in the recommendations report.  
6.9.3  Location of an energy performance  certificate  
The energy performance certificate should be indelibly marked and located in a position 
that is readily accessible, protected from weather and not easily obscured. A suitable 
location could be in a cupboard containing the gas or electricity meter or the water supply 
stopcock.

Mandatory Standard  
Standard 6.10  
Every building must be designed and constructed in such a way that each 
building or part of a building designed for different occupation is fitted with fuel 
and power meters.  
Limitation:  
This standard does not apply to:  
a) domestic  buildings  
b) district or block heating systems where each part of the building 
designed for different occupation is fitted with heat meters,  or 
c) heating fired by solid fuel or biomass.

Page 468 Applicable from 5  June 2023  Annex 6.A Compensatory  approach  - heat  loss 
example  
Note: the pre- 2002 Annex 6.A (Compensating U -values for windows, doors and rooflights) 
is deleted -  no longer relevant as U -values for opening types now differ.  
6.A.0  Introduction 
This annex gives an example of the compensatory approach for use in the desi gn of 
conversions, extensions and alterations. This is likely to be of use where there is a need to 
specify one or more constructions with a U -value higher than the recommended maximum 
area- weighted average U -values given the table to clause 6.2.1.  
The examples given in this instance are for an attic conversion and for a single storey 
extension, however the same principles apply to other substantial alterations, extensions 
and conversions:  
* example 6.A.1 shows use of better U -values to some elements to compensate for lack 
of headroom in an attic conversion.  
* example 6.A.2 shows use of better U -values to enable a larger area of glazing within 
an extension.  
Note that this method can only be used in conversions, if the recommended U -values are 
met in full, not where values are being met as far as is reasonably practicable.  
Separate work under the same building warrant  
A single compensatory approach calculation can be carried out to cover separate areas of 
work to an existing dwelling provided the same assessment criteria (maximum U - values, 
etc) are applicable to each area of work.  
6.A.1  Example:  alteration  to create  rooms  in a roof space  
Note: where works are a conversion, works are subject to the U -values in the table to 
clause 6.2.1. This example seeks to meet these in full.  
It is proposed to form two rooms in the roof space of an existing single storey dwelling. 
The extra floor area created (including opening for stairway) will be 36.4 m2. A plan and 
section of the proposed layout is shown in the figure below. A key part of the design is to 
create as much headroom as possible below the new coombe ceilings. The existing rafters 
are only 125 mm deep therefore it is difficult to achieve the recommended elemental U -
value of 0.12, without using branders or  having an excessive thickness of insulated ceiling 
lining.  
The principal compensatory measure will be to highly insulate the attic walls that occur 
directly below the lowest part of the coombes. The existing gables will be provided with 
insulated internal  wall lining to improve the U -value where the insulation envelope now 
occurs. The four 1.6 m2 roof windows installed have timber frames. The floor that will be 
formed at the line of the existing ceiling ties is wholly within the insulation envelope and is 
therefore disregarded for the purposes of this calculation.  
The adjusted maximum U -value for a roof window at a pitch of 35% is 1.7 (+0.3).  
Procedure:

but with its area of window/doors/  rooflights  taken as a maximum 25% of the floor area)  is 
calculated using the U-values  in the table to clause  6.2.1.

insulation envelope that have different  area weighted U-values are calculated.  
* The heat loss for the proposed attic is calculated  using  proposed U-values  for building 
elements,  which  may be higher  or lower  than those recommended in table to clause  
* 6.2.1.  The percentage  area of windows/doors/rooflight  area as proposed  may also be 
greater or less than  25%.  
* Finally,  the heat loss calculated  for the proposed  attic should be less than or equal  to that 
for the 'notional'  one. 
Calculate the rate of heat loss from the 'notional attic' as follows:

From the above comparison, the rate of heat loss from the proposed attic (24.07) is less 
than that from the 'notional attic' (25.03). Proposals will comply.  
Additional insulation work  
The existing dwelling is of an age where there was no insulation provided in the roof space 
at the time of the original construction. Guidance on 'reconstruction of elements' within 
clause 6.2.10 recommends  that where an element forming part of the insulation envelope 
is to be altered or dismantled and rebuilt, the opportunity should be taken to improve the 
level of thermal insulation.  
In this example, there is no technical risk or other reason which prevent s the level ceiling 
at the eaves of the roof (see X on the section) being upgraded to achieve a U - value of 
0.12 as noted in the table to clause 6.2.1. This would therefore be required as part of the 
proposed works.  
6.A.2  Example:  single  storey  extension  
It is proposed to form a single room, flat -roof extension to the rear of an existing dwelling. 
The floor area of the extension is 18.0 m2 and it is to be built over existing openings totalling 
1.5 m2 in area. A plan and section of the proposed layout is shown in the figure below.  
Figure 6.2 Single Storey extension  
 
A key element of the design is provision of significant glazing (5.0 m2) to the end wall of the 
extension to provide views across the large garden and rooflights (2.0 m2) to maximise light

Page 471 Applicable from 5  June 2023  into the existing dwelling. However, this area of openings is in excess of the maximum 
recommended in clause 6.2.8, 25% of the extension floor area plus any built -over openings. 
To achieve compliance with Standard 6.2, it is proposed to increase insulation U -values to 
wall, floor, roof and rooflights.  
Procedure:  
* The heat loss for a 'notional extension' (i.e. one the same size and shape as the 
proposed extension but with the area of window/do ors/rooflights taken as a maximum 
25% of the floor area plus the area of any built-over openings)  is calculated using the U- 
values in the table to clause 6.2.1. To simplify calculation, the notional extension is 
assumed  to have windows/doors  but no rooflights,  with the 25% glazing  area deducted 
from walls.  
* The internal  exposed  surface areas  of each of the elements  of the proposed  building 
insulation  envelope that have different area-weighted U-values are calculated.  
* The heat loss for the proposed extension is calculated using proposed U-values for 
building  elements,  which  may be higher  or lower  than those recommended in the table  to 
clause 6.2.1. The percentage area of windows/doors/rooflight area, as proposed, may 
also be greater  or less than 25%.  
* The total area of exposed elements will not be the same for notional and proposed 
extensions  where there  is any area of built-over openings,  which  are added only to the 
notional  extension.  
* Finally,  the heat loss for the proposed extension should be less than or equal  to that for 
the 'notional'  one. 
Calculate the rate of heat loss from the 'notional' extension as follows:

Page 473 Applicable from 5  June 2023  Annex 6.B - Consideration of High- Efficiency 
Alternative Systems in New Buildings  
6.B.0  Introduction 
For new buildings, before construction starts, the applicant must ensure that the technical, 
environmental and economic feasibility of high- efficiency alternative systems such as 
those listed below, is considered and taken into account:  
* decentralised energy  supply  systems based on energy  from renewable sources  
* cogeneration  
* district  or block  heating or cooling,  particularly  where it is based  entirely  or partially  on 
energy from renewable sources  
* heat pumps  
Accordingly, a statement on how these technologies were considered in arriving at the 
solution within a building warrant submission should accompany each appli cation for 
building warrant for a new building  
This is relevant to systems specified in relation to Standard 6.3 (heating systems) and, 
where mechanical cooling is proposed, Standard 6.6 (mechanical ventilation and air 
conditioning) and also to use of low or zero carbon generating technologies which 
contribute to meeting emissions targets set under Standard 6.1 (carbon dioxide 
emissions).  
6.B.1  Implications for   design 
This requirement has no direct implications for the design, specification and construction of 
new buildings and the functional standards and guidance applicable to heating and cooling 
systems within the Technical Handbooks are unchanged as a result.  
Applicants are not required to use the described technologies. The purpose of this 
provision is  to encourage awareness and consideration of such solutions.  
Whilst new buildings do not have to incorporate such technologies, the challenging 
standards set under Standard 6.1 do mean that they are a more common part of design 
solutions in energy efficient, low carbon buildings. For example, elements such as 
photovoltaic (PV) panels and an electric heat pump are noted in the specification to set the 
energy and emissions targets for new homes.  
This means that a range of 'high- efficiency alternative systems'  will be considered as a 
matter of course as part of the design process for new homes. This process should not 
therefore generate a separate and detailed options analysis but will simply record the key 
outcomes of discussions on this topic during the design process.  
Noting also that district/block heating and heat pumps are solution identified as non-  'direct 
emissions heating systems' with specific provisions applied where such solutions are 
employed under standards 6.1 and 6.8.  
 
 
################# - Page 474 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition   
 
Page 474 Applicable from 5  June 2023  6.B.2  Process  
When submitting a building warrant, applicants should include a short design statement 
identifying how the technologies identified in this Annex were discussed and considered as 
options during the design process and the outcome of that process as shown in submi tted 
proposals.  
These technologies include, but need not be limited  to: 
* decentralised energy  supply  systems (technologies  that do not rely directly  on the high-  
voltage electricity transmission network or gas grid) based on energy from renewable 
sources  
* cogeneration - e.g. combined  heat and power  (CHP)  
* district  or block  heating  or cooling  - including  partial  or full use of renewable energy 
sources,  and 
* heat pump  technologies  
There is no prescribed format or standard form for this exercise but the statement should 
include at least the following elements.  
* Applicant  - name,  address  and contact  details  
* Duly authorised Agent  (if any) - name,  address  and contact  details  
* Owner  (only  if different  from applicant)  - name,  address  and contact  details  
* Location of building  or site to which  the application relates  - address  & post code  (if 
known)  
* Proposed use of building 
The above information should be as recorded on the building warrant application form, 
plus 
* In providing solutions  which  meet  Standards  6.1 (carbon dioxide  emissions),  6.3 (heating 
system) and 6.6 (mechanical ventilation and air conditioning), is use of high- efficiency 
alternative systems specified?  (if yes, list solutions used).  
* If such  systems are present,  main  reasons  influencing the decision  to use. 
* If such  systems  not used,  note the main  reasons  for the decision  to not adopt  them.  
Analysis may be as concise or as comprehensive as the applicant considers to be 
appropriate to the level of discussion that occurred and type and complexity of the project.  
A single assessment can be provided with each building warrant though the assessment 
may have to include separate analysis sections where buildings are different in form or 
use. Analysis of alternative systems may be carri ed out for individual buildings or for 
groups of similar buildings or for common typologies of buildings in the same area.  
Once submitted, the statement is retained with other building warrant information as a 
document of record. The verifier is only required to record receipt of the statement and takes 
no action in respect of the content.

Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 476 Applicable from 5  June 2023  Section 7 -  Sustainability 
7.0 Introduction  
7.0.1  Background 
Sustainable development has been defined as meeting "the needs of the present without 
compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs" by the Brundtland 
Commission of the United Nations in 1983. It follows that the process of sustainable 
development and the quality of 'sustainability' to aspire to within the built environment 
should account for:  
* social, economic and environmental factors  
* the potential for long- term maintenance of human well -being in and around buildings  
* the well -being of the natural world and the responsible use of natural resources, without 
destroying the ecological balance of the area where these resources originate or are 
processed, and  
* the ability for the built environment to be maintained.  
The Building (Scotland) Act 2003 allows Scottish Ministers to regulate for the purpose of 
furthering the achievement of sustainable development. In Scotland, sustainability is 
embedded into the building regulations for all new buildings, rather than reference being 
made to new buildings achieving levels within a voluntary system. Since 2005, progress 
has been made by strengthening the standards on, for example, energy efficiency and 
accessibility for all new buildings so they are comparable with the best in Europe.  
Whilst the standards within Sections 1 -  6 of the 2013 Technical Handbooks deliver a level 
of sustainability in a number of areas such as energy efficiency, surface water drainage and 
sound insulation, there is always the possibility of going beyond the minimum standard. 
Developers may wish to gain recognition for building to higher standards. Additionally, 
organisations such as planning authorities or funding bodies may choose to make 
constructing to a higher level of sustainability a condition of  approval or funding.  
Defining higher standards to measure sustainability will enable higher quality buildings to be 
created and for such benefits to be formally recognised. The introduction of Section 7 is a 
means of encouraging the design and construction of all new buildings within a broader 
context of sustainable development. Within Section 7, specific further provisions applicable 
to development which are not otherwise addressed within sections 1 to 6, such as 
measures which support our transition towards more sustainable forms of transport, can 
broaden the scope of useful action delivered by these standards.  
7.0.2  Aims  
The standards in Section 7 identify topics which, if addressed, will contribute in a material 
way to make new development more sustainable.  
The intention of Standard 7.1 (Statement of sustainability) is to:   
* recognise the level of sustainability already achieved by the building regulations. By 
setting the 2010 Standards as the benchmark level, credit is given to meeting the 
################# - Page 477 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 477 Applicable from 5  June 2023  standards wit hin Sections 1 -  6 of the building regulations. This emphasises  that a 
degree of sustainable design and construction is not a niche market but must be 
achieved in all new buildings ; 
* encourage more demanding sustainability standards through enhanced upper l evels ; 
and 
* encourage consistency between planning authorities that use supplementary guidance 
to promote higher measures of sustainable construction in their geographical areas. By 
making reference to this standard, local aspirations can be met by selection of clear 
national benchmarks. Levels of sustainability have been defined that must include a low 
or zero carbon generating technology, with reference to Section 72 of the Climate 
Change (Scotland) Act 2009.  
The intention of Standard 7.2 (Electric vehicle charging) is to make provision for electric 
vehicle charging within new development and specific renovation works. Supporting the 
adoption and convenient use of low and zero emission vehicles where parking facilities are 
provided as part of new development. 
7.0.3  Scope  
The measures on sustainability are broadly related to the built form but some matters that 
are associated with sustainable development such as location and transport cannot be 
adequately delivered by the building standards system. The scope of the measures  can be 
divided into two sets:  
* Climate change, energy and resource use - Promote the more efficient use of 
energy, fuel and water in buildings. Reducing water use will reduce the energy 
consumed and the carbon emissions associated with distributing, proces sing and 
heating of water. It is also important that building occupants have the opportunity to 
understand how their behaviour can reduce use of these resources.  
* Quality of life; material use and waste -  Homes should be designed to accommodate 
flexible liv ing, working and studying patterns for individuals, groups and families. More 
aspects of designing for well -being, such as daylighting rooms more effectively and 
protecting from noise from adjacent buildings, should be promoted for all new home 
occupants.  
There are areas considered inappropriate for inclusion in the optional upper levels for 
domestic buildings due to the complexity of some subjects related to building design such 
as material sourcing and embodied energy. However the Sullivan Report ('A Low Carbon 
Building Standards Strategy for Scotland'; published by Scottish Ministers in 2007) 
recommends total -life zero carbon buildings by 2030. This standard can respond in due 
course to the growing relative importance of embodied energy as the performance of new 
buildings improves further. At present these areas are outside the scope of this standard. 
Reference to external examples of guidance that allow appraisal of local or ethical 
construction material sourcing, embodied energy and use of recycled mater ials are the 
BRE's Green Guide to Specification and the materials section on www.greenspec.co.uk . 
7.0.4  Explanation of  terms 
Aspect is a term used for a subject area of sustainability. Due to the coverage of building 
standards and the position of the warrant process in the overall development process, 
################# - Page 478 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 478 Applicable from 5  June 2023  aspects covering resource use and performance are more prominent in this standard. 
Examples of aspects named and defined i n this standard for dwellings are:  
* Energy for water heating  
* Well- being and security, and  
* Material use and waste 
Within the aspect of flexibility and adaptability a 'home office' is a space for a desk in a 
dwelling to allow work or study. A mobility space i s a space that could accommodate an 
electric wheelchair or an infant's pram or a bicycle.  
Level is the term used as a banding, where all the aspects of sustainability have reached a 
certain cut -off point. Upper levels in some aspects may become absorbed into guidance in 
Sections 1 to 6 to meet revised mandatory functional standards following future reviews of 
these sections. However, they should not be seen as predictions because the process for 
review of these sections are independent of Section 7. It is p ossible that levels that are 
more demanding may be added into Section 7 in the future.  
7.0.5  Latest  changes  
The following change is introduced from 5 June 2023:  
* Standard 7.2 -  new standard introduced, setting out requirements for the provis ion of 
electric vehicle charging facilities and enabling infrastructure as part of new 
development and 'major renovation' work.  
7.0.6  Relevant  legislation 
The Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009 introduced clause 3F into the Town and Country 
Planning (Scotland) Act 1997. This places an obligation on local authorities within their 
development plans to avoid a specified and rising proportion of greenhouse gases by use of 
low and zero carbon generating technologies. Some of the levels in this standard could be 
referred to by local authorities when setting local policy in response to this legislation.  
7.0.7  Certification  
Scottish Ministers can, under Section 7 of the Building (Scotland) Act 2003, approve 
schemes for the certification of design or constructi on for compliance with the mandatory 
functional standards. Such schemes are approved on the basis that the procedures 
adopted by the scheme will take account of the need to co- ordinate the work of various 
designers and specialist contractors. Individuals approved to provide certification services 
under the scheme are assessed to make sure that they have the qualifications, skills and 
experience to certify compliance for the work covered by the scope of the scheme. 
Checking procedures adopted by Approved Cer tifiers will deliver design or installation 
reliability in accordance with legislation.  
7.0.8  Other sustainability  indicators  
Other tools to assess a level of sustainability for new buildings exist and are used in 
Scotland. These indicators may be selected as appropriate for some developments 
because they cover issues such as location, orientation on site, or transport that are 
################# - Page 479 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 479 Applicable from 5  June 2023  broader than building regulations can include. Other established indicators place greater 
emphasis on the sourcing and embodied energy of construction materials, an area flagged 
up in this section for future review. Other tools could be complementary in an assessment 
of sustainability but they cannot be used as a method to meet an optional upper level of 
sustainability within building regulations.

Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 480 Applicable from 5  June 2023  7.1 Statement of sustainability 
Mandatory Standard  
 
Standard 7.1  
Every building must be designed and constructed in such a way that:  
a) with regard to a dwelling or school building containing classrooms, a 
level of sustainability specified by the Scottish Ministers in respect of 
carbon dioxide emissions, resource use, building flexibility, adaptability 
and occupant well - being is achieved  
b) with regard to a non- domestic building other than a school building 
containing classrooms, a level of sustainability specified by the Scottish 
Ministers in respect of carbon dioxide emissions is achieved, and  
c) a statement of the level of sustainability achieved is affixed to the 
dwelling or non- domestic building.  
Limitation:  
This standard does not apply to:  
a) alterations and extensions to buildings  
b) conversions of buildings  
c) buildings that are ancillary to a dwelling that are stand -alone having an 
area less than 50 square metres  
d) buildings which will not be heated or cooled other than by heating 
provided solely for th e purpose of frost protection 
e) buildings intended to have a life not exceeding the period specified in 
regulation 6, or 
f) conservatories.  
 
 
7.1.0  Statement of sustainability (sustainability  label)  
The statement of sustainability (sustainability label, or SL) that includes the level of 
sustainability achieved must be fixed to the building prior to completion. The sustainability 
label should be indelibly marked and located in a position that is readil y accessible, 
protected from weather and not easily obscured. A suitable location could be in a internal 
cupboard containing a utility meter or the owner may choose to display the label in a more 
prominent location. An example of an approved label with the overall level achieved on the 
left hand side and the levels achieved in each of the individual aspects of sustainability on 
the right hand side is given in Annex E. A program to generate such a label that is specific 
to a building can be accessed here: http://www.s7sust.co.uk/ . 
 
################# - Page 481 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 481 Applicable from 5  June 2023  7.1.1  Levels of  sustainability 
The specified level of sustainability for a dwelling should be selected from the following:  
 
* Bronze or Bronze Active 
* Silver o r Silver Active  
* Gold  
The aim is for balance in the setting of upper levels because sustainability is considered in 
the round rather than focusing on issues of energy or carbon emissions. Reaching upper 
levels should be a valid target for any new developmen t, regardless of size or location. 
Generally, levels have been set to avoid individual aspects that could upset applications 
which might otherwise meet all of the other aspects of sustainability.  
The first optional upper level 'Silver' offers substantial benefits in a range of sustainability 
aspects which should be achievable by a sector of the mainstream market. The second 
optional upper level 'gold' is a more demanding target, initially aimed at those intent on 
pursuing best practice.  
Buildings that exceed a gold sustainability level are also welcomed. A third upper level 
called 'platinum' has been reserved for further recognition within the building standards 
system. At present, only the aspect of carbon dioxide emissions has been defined for this 
level.  
Buildings that exceed Bronze, Bronze Active, Silver, Silver Active or Gold levels by 
achieving a higher level criteria in one or more of the aspects are welcome. This additional 
achievement will be reflected on the sustainability label. However the achieve ment of the 
next upper level will only be recognised once all aspects of that particular level have been 
included. The award of an overall upper level depends upon meeting all aspects, rather 
than allowing trade- offs to achieve a score, reinforcing the fac t that sustainable outcomes 
rely on holistic integrated design.  
The specified levels of sustainability in clauses 7.1.2 to 7.1.7, are sets of measures that are 
transparent to all including verifiers, planners, funding bodies, owners and tenants. To meet 
this standard, it should not be necessary to secure expert evaluation beyond that already 
used in the design to demonstrate compliance with the standards in Sections 1 to 6.  
7.1.2  Bronze  level  
This is the baseline level for sustainability achieved where the dwelling meets the functional 
standards set out in Sections 1 -  6 of this Handbook.  
7.1.3  Bronze Active  level  
This is the baseline level where the dwelling meets the functional standards set out in 
Sections 1 - 6 of this Handbook, but in addition the dwell ing includes the use of a low and 
zero carbon generating technology (LZCGT) in respect of meeting Standard 6.1 within 
Section 6, Energy. This level is primarily to assist local authorities to meet their obligations 
under Section 72 of the Climate Change (S cotland) Act 2009 by identifying the use of 
LZCGT. In this respect, LZCGTs include: wind turbines, water turbines, heat pumps (all 
varieties), solar thermal panels, photovoltaic panels, combined heat and power units (fired 
by low emission sources), fuel cells, biomass boilers/stoves and biogas.  
################# - Page 482 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 482 Applicable from 5  June 2023  7.1.4  Silver level  
A dwelling at this first optional upper level should meet all the standards in Sections 1 -  6 
that apply to the building for the Bronze level and, in addition, the dwelling should comply 
with the S ilver level in each of the eight aspects below.  
Aspect Silver level 1: Carbon dioxide emissions  
All new dwellings that meet or improve upon the Target Emissions Rate (TER) or, where 
not calculated, the Target Delivered Energy Rate (TDER), as detailed in guidance to 
Standard 6.1 in this 2022 Handbook, will be deemed to meet the Gold level criteria in 
respect of CO 2 emissions.  
This level is assigned as assessment of the national impact of these standards delivers a 
46% improvement on the 2010 s tandards used to define the levels of this aspect.  
Aspect Silver level 2: Energy for space heating  
Maximum annual demand for useful energy for space heating should be 40 kWh/m2 for 
houses or 30 kWh/m2 for flats or maisonettes  
To assess, the output from box  no.99 of the SAP 10 Dwelling worksheet should be no more 
than the figures above.  
Aspect Silver level 3: Energy for water heating  
At least 5% of the dwelling or domestic building's annual energy demand for water heating 
should be from:  
* heat recovery and/or  renewable sources with little or no associated fuel costs (e.g. solar 
thermal water heating and associated storage or heat recovery from greywater) that are 
allocated for water heating.  
To assess, the annual energy demand for water heating in kWh multipli ed by 0.05, should 
be no more than the contribution from specified equipment that uses renewable energy 
and/or heat recovery. A SAP spreadsheet is available for this calculation at http:// 
www.bre.co.uk/sap10/scotland- section -7-sustainability/ . 
Where a building contains more than one dwelling (such as a block of flats or terrace of 
houses) the average annual energy demand for water heating may be met by installations 
of renewable sources and/or heat recovery for the block. This is similar to the buildings with 
multiple dwellings guidance in Section 6.  
Aspect Silver level 4: Water use efficiency  
Enhanced or additional products should be provided as follows:  
* WCs of average flush volume not more than 4.5 litres  
* Wash hand basin taps with a flow rate not more than 6 l/m  
* shower heads with a flow rate not more than 8 l/m, and  
* 1 water butt (with a min. capacity of 200 litres) for outdoor use per dwelling. D wellings 
without a private garden or landscaped area, or if there is no access to rainwater 
collection (for example if there is no external rainwater pipe within the curtilage) are 
excluded.  
The flow rates referred to align with performance bands in the Bathroom Manufacturers 
Association's water efficient product labelling scheme (BMA scheme). Reference can to be 
################# - Page 483 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 483 Applicable from 5  June 2023  made to the performance bands within the BMA scheme or equivalent standards. Kitchen 
or utility room sinks are not included in low flow fitting targets at this level.  
Consideration should be given to the flow rates that combi boilers (if fitted) need to activate 
their water heating function when specifying taps and shower heads with lower flow rates. 
When installing low volume flush WCs, the pipe di ameter and gradient inter -relationship is 
critical in order that the new and any existing sections of the drain are self -cleansing.  
Aspect Silver level 5: Optimising Performance  
a. Quick start guide : Provide guidance to the occupants on the ways in which the 
specific dwelling is intended to function and how to optimise its performance on the 
scope, format and contents of the guide for occupants. Supplementary guidance with a 
performance specification as well as links to an example completed quick start guide is 
in Annex B.  
This is additional to the written information to be provided to occupants under Section 6.  
b. Resource use display: Install a real -time resource use monitor that displays electricity 
use, located in an easily accessible and readable position.  
Aspect Silver level 6: Flexibility and Adaptability  
Provide a home office space dedicated for home working/study to include:  
* A clear space, against a wall or partition, where a desk of 1800 mm long x 600 mm 
deep could be placed. Alternatively, the desk space could be 'L' shaped in plan as long 
as each leg of the 'L' is a minimum length of 1200 mm. Diagrams below show the two 
desk options with associated activity spaces.  
* 2 switched electrical sockets in addition to those that should be provided under Section 4.  
* A connection to allow direct access to internet services (unless such a provision is 
made elsewhere in the dwelling).  
* For natural daylight there should be line of sight to a window, glazed external door or 
rooflight.  
* Generally ventilation, accessibility, safety and escape should meet all the other 
standards however, see paragraphs below.  
For diagram, see Annex C . 
In any dwel ling, the home office space can be in a circulation space but should not be 
located in a protected enclosure. The desk space and/or its activity space can locally 
reduce a corridor width to 800 mm and should not interfere with door swings.  
In any dwelling,  the home office space can occupy a room by itself even if this room is too 
small to be an apartment. In this case, this small room should be ventilated as if it were an 
apartment.  
In any dwelling, the home office space can occupy a part of the enhanced apartment but 
the desk space and its activity space should be additional to the defined spaces and access 
of the enhanced apartment, as described in guidance in Section 3.  
In any dwelling the home office space can be in a room that includes the kitchen but t he 
desk space and or its activity space should not interfere with kitchen worktops, appliances 
or manoeuvring spaces.  
################# - Page 484 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 484 Applicable from 5  June 2023  To allow some more flexibility in smaller dwellings (those of not more than 2 apartments) 
the home office space can be in any apartment. B ut in this case, the desk space and its 
activity space should not overlap with the minimum furniture provision or associated activity 
spaces.  
The height of the home office should be not less than 1.8 m over the activity space and 1.5 
m over the desk space.  For dwellings over 150 m2 floor area, two home office spaces 
should be provided.  
Aspect Silver level 7: Well -being and security  
a. Noise separation : Design performance levels for separating walls and separating 
floors associated with attached dwellings shoul d be:  
* Minimum airborne sound insulation: 58 dB  DnT,w 
* Maximum impact sound transmission: 54 dB  L'nT,w 
Performance levels for noise isolation for separating walls and separating floors should 
be verified by carrying out a sound test as indicated in the guida nce to Section 5.  
b. Noise reduction between rooms : Design performance level for a minimum airborne 
sound insulation should be 44 dB  Rw. 
This refers to all internal partitions in all dwellings and intermediate floors within houses 
and maisonettes excluding st orage cupboards and should be substantiated by 
manufacturer's laboratory test certificates.  
c. Enhanced natural lighting: The enhanced apartment should be provided with a 
glazed area of not less than 1/8th of the floor area of the apartment.  
d. Security : Install a 13 amp fused spur, suitable for an intruder alarm system, located 
within 2 m of the main entrance door.  
Aspect Silver level 8: Material use and waste 
Recycling of solid waste : Provide a dedicated internal space with a volume of at least  
0.12 m3(120 litres) and no dimension less than 450 mm, for storing recyclable material.  
The storage space should:  
* be able to store small amounts of recyclable material (e.g. metal, glass, plastic, 
cardboard and/or paper)  
* be easily cleanable  
* be additional to the general 1 m3 kitchen storage in Section 3,  and 
* facilitate temporary storage before transfer to a main storage point or a collection point, 
whether for the dwelling or for a group of dwellings.  
It is recognised that local authority provision, resourc es and preferences for collecting 
separately or together will vary across Scotland. Therefore subdivision into containers for 
different materials is optional.  
7.1.5  Silver Active  level  
This is the same as the silver level but, in addition, the dwelling inc ludes the use of a low 
and zero carbon generating technology (LZCGT) in respect of meeting at least one of the 
aspects: Silver 1, Silver 2 or Silver 3. This level is primarily to assist local authorities to 
################# - Page 485 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 485 Applicable from 5  June 2023  meet their obligations under Section 72 of the Cl imate Change (Scotland) Act 2009 by 
identifying the use of LZCGT. In this respect, LZCGTs include: wind turbines, water 
turbines, heat pumps (all varieties), solar thermal panels, photovoltaic panels, combined 
heat and power units (fired by low emission sources), fuel cells, biomass boilers/stoves and 
biogas.  
7.1.6  Gold  level  
A dwelling at this second optional upper level should meet all the standards in Sections 1 - 
6 that apply to the building for the bronze level and in addition the dwelling should compl y 
with the gold level in each of the eight aspects below.  
Aspect Gold level 1: Carbon dioxide emissions  
All new dwellings that meet or improve upon the Target Emissions Rate (TER) or, where 
not calculated, the Target Delivered Energy Rate (TDER), as detail ed in guidance to 
Standard 6.1 in this 2022 Handbook, will be deemed to meet the Gold level criteria in 
respect of CO 2 emissions.  
This level is assigned as assessment of the national impact of these standards delivers a 
46% improvement on the 2010 standards used to define the levels of this aspect.  
Aspect Gold level 2: Energy for space heating  
Maximum annual demand for useful energy for space heating should be:  
* 30 kWh/m2 for houses,  or 
* 20 kWh/m2 for flats or  maisonettes  
To assess, the output from box no.99 of the SAP 10 Dwelling worksheet should be no more 
than the figures above.  
Aspect Gold 3: Energy for water heating  
a. Renewables and heat recovery: At least 50% of the dwelling or domestic building's 
annual energy demand for water heating should be from:  
* heat recovery and/or renewable sources with little or no associated fuel costs (e.g. 
solar thermal water heating and associated storage or heat recovery from 
greywater) that are allocated for water heating.  
To assess, the annual energy demand for water heating in kWh multiplied by 0.5, 
should be no more than the contribution from specified equipment that uses renewable 
energy and/or heat recovery. A SAP spreadsheet is available for this calculation at 
http:// www.bre.co.uk/sap10/scotland- section- 7-sustainability/ . 
Where a building contains more than one dwelling (such as a block of flats or terrace of 
houses) the average annual energy demand for water heating may be met by 
installations of renewable sources and/or heat recovery for the block. This is similar to 
the buildings with multiple dwellings guidance in Section 6.  
b. Water heating display: A display showing the performance of the primary renew able 
source, such as a solar collector, should be mounted in easily accessible space, for 
instance alongside controls for heating equipment or near the bathroom/shower room  
door.  
 
################# - Page 486 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 486 Applicable from 5  June 2023  Aspect Gold 4: Water use efficiency  
Enhanced or additional products should be provided to encourage water efficiency as 
follows:  
* 1 water butt (with a min. capacity of 200 litres) for outdoor use per dwelling. Dwellings 
without a garden or landscaped area, or if there is no access to rainwater collection (for 
example if there is no external rainwater pipe within the curtilage) are excluded, and  
* 3 of the following 5 items:  
 water meter  
 WCs of average flush volume to be not more than 3.5 litres  
 wash hand basin taps of flow rates not more than 4 l/m and to kitchen or utility room 
sinks to be not more than 6 l/m  
 shower heads with maximum flow rate not more than 6 l/m  
 rainwater harvesting or greywater recycling system designed to provide water for 
toilet flushing.  
The flow rates referred to align with performance bands in the Bathroom Manufacturers 
Association's water efficient product labelling scheme (BMA scheme). Reference can 
be made to the performance bands within the BMA scheme or equivalent standards.  
Consideration should be given to the flow rates that combi -boilers (if fitted) need to 
activate their water heating function when specifying taps and shower heads with lower 
flow rates.  
When installing low volume flush WCs, the pipe diameter and gradient inter -relationship 
is critical in order that the new and any existing sections of the drain are self -cleansing.  
Aspect Gold 5: Optimising Performance  
a. Quick start guide: Provide as for Aspect Silver 5, plus: Direct 'easy release' adhesive 
labels on all key heating and ventilation equipment including (where fitted): trickle 
ventilators, extract fans, mechanical ventilation with heat recovery (MVHR), heating 
controls (programmers, Thermostatic Radiator Valves (TRVs)). Supplementary 
guidance on the content of the direct equipment labels is in Annex  B. 
b. Resource use display: Provide as for Asp ect Silver 5, plus the real -time resource 
display indicates gas use (if gas is used for heating), displaying gas use at least at a 
daily period.  
Aspect Gold 6: Flexibility and adaptability  
a. Home office: Provide as for Aspect Silver 6.  
b. Mobility space: Provide convenient secure mobility space to accommodate an electric 
wheelchair(s) and that could also be suitable for pram storage and the storage of a 
bicycle(s). The size is defined as follows:  
* An electric wheelchair (or pram) storage space of: 0.8 m x 1.1 m on plan, minimum 
height of 1.8 m. For dwellings of 4 apartments or more; or over 150 m2; space for 
two electric wheelchairs and  
################# - Page 487 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 487 Applicable from 5  June 2023  * A bicycle storage space of: 2 m x 0.75 m on plan, minimum height of 1.2 m. For 
dwellings of 3 apartments or  more; or over 150 m2; space for two bicycles: 1 m x  
1.5 m.  
A single infant's pram or pushchair should generally be able to use the mobility space 
as defined by either the cycle or wheelchair footprint. The space does not need to be 
able to store a wheelchair at the same time as a pram or bicycle; this diagram shows 
how the spaces can overlap.  
For diagram, see Annex D . 
The mobility space should have a socket outlet for recharging. Ideally, it should be 
adjacent to the accessible entrance. It should not be l ocated in a protected enclosure 
and it should be outwith the minimum corridor width noted in Section 4, clear of any 
door way, door swing, stair landing or space identified for a future stairlift installation.  
The mobility space in the dwelling would be defined only by the wheelchair size(s) if 
either of the areas below are present, allowing the bicycle storage provision to be 
located outwith the dwelling:  
* A motor vehicle garage could be adequate as long as bicycle storage is outwith a 
4.8 m x 2.4 m space f or parking a single motor vehicle or  
* Communal bicycle storage that is secure (locked with resident only key access) and 
weather protected. This should be sized on the number of apartments in total or 
overall size of all dwellings served. The communal store should be at ground level 
or accessible by a ramp.  
If separate bicycle storage is allocated (garage or communal store), this does not need 
an electrical socket outlet. The storage provision for more than one bicycle could be 
split between a dwelling and a  communal store.  
c. General storage provision within a dwelling : Accessible storage of 1 m3 in volume 
per apartment. The storage space should be capable of being closed off with a door but 
does not need to be off each  apartment.  
General storage is in addition to a wardrobe space or built -in wardrobe, or storage that is 
designated for the future provision of a shower. Both of these are identified in Section 3.  
Aspect Gold 7: Well -being and security  
a. Noise separation: Design performance levels for separating wall s and separating 
floors associated with attached dwellings should be:  
* Minimum airborne sound insulation: 60 dB  DnT,w 
* Maximum impact sound transmission: 52 dB  L'nT,w 
Performance levels for noise isolation for separating walls and separating floors should 
be verified by carrying out a sound test as indicated in the guidance to Section 5.  
b. Noise between rooms: Design performance level for a minimum airborne sound 
insulation should be 45 dB  Rw. 
This refers to all internal partitions in all dwellings and intermediate floors within houses 
and maisonettes excluding storage cupboards and should be substantiated by 
manufacturer's laboratory test certificates.  
################# - Page 488 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 488 Applicable from 5  June 2023  c. Enhanced natural lighting: Provide as Aspect Silver 7 plus the average daylight factor 
(average DF) f or kitchens and living room/dining/study should be 1.5% and 2% 
respectively, using the simplified calculation below.  
The DF is a factor, expressed as a percentage, that will rise or fall depending on the 
relationship of glazed area and room dimensions. Here it is simplified as an average for 
a particular room. Matters pertaining to overshadowing, neighbouring buildings or 
orientation are removed from this calculation.  
Average DF% = (52 x M x W) / A  
Where:  
A = The sum of the area of all room s urfaces (ceiling, floor, walls, doors, windows and 
rooflights), in m2. 
M = Correction factor for dirt or ease of cleaning, consisting of:  
* 1.0 for vertical glazing or  
* 0.8 for sloping glazing or  
* 0.7 for horizontal glazing.  
W = Glazed area of windows or roofl ights, taking account of framing, in m2. Measure 
glazed panes or measure window area including frames then multiply by:  
* 0.9 for metal frames (patent glazing) or  
* 0.8 for metal frames (large pane) or  
* 0.7 for timber frames (large pane) or  
* 0.6 for timber frames ('Georgian' pane).  
Assume the factors for PVC framed windows are equal to timber.  
d. Security: Provide as Aspect Silver 7 plus:  
* provide doorsets and windows which are tested and certified by a notified body as 
meeting a recognised standard for security or  
* install a full intruder alarm system that complies with BS EN 50131 and PD6662 
(wired system) or a Class VI alarm to BS 6799 (wire free system) that conforms to 
Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) guidelines.  
e. Outdoor space: Provide private or communal outdoor space with room for occupants 
to sit outside. The outdoor space should be accessible only to occupants of designated 
houses or flats and not be occupied by car or cycle parking space, waste storage area, 
electricity substations or other ancillar y features. It must comprise of at least one of the 
following:  
* a private garden, patio, roof terrace or balcony (with the front open to air, or see 
Note 1 below) of an area no less than 1.5 m2/apartment (minimum 3 m2/home) with 
a minimum short dimension of  1.2 m or  
* a communal shared garden or courtyard that is:  
 of an area no less than 1.5 m2/apartment (minimum 3 m2/home) with a 
minimum short dimension of 2 m  
 secure by, for example, resident only key access  
################# - Page 489 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 489 Applicable from 5  June 2023   secluded and fully enclosed with buildings themselv es, walls, fencing or 
planting are all permitted possibilities to define the space.  
Generally issues of daylight, ventilation, safety and escape should meet the guidance of 
all the other mandatory standards. Access to these spaces should follow the guidanc e 
of Section 4.  
Note 1 : In a studio or single bedroom flat (i.e. a flat with 2 apartments or less) then the 
balcony could be a 'Juliet' type where the size could then be provided by a space 
immediately inside of an inward opening glazed door or door(s) and has a protective 
barrier externally. This space should not:  
* interfere with the defined space or access of an enhanced apartment  
* overlap with minimum furniture provision or associated activity spaces and  
* interfere with kitchen worktops, applianc es or manoeuvring spaces.  
Aspect Gold 8: Material use and waste  
a. Recycling of solid waste: Provide as for Aspect Silver 8.  
b. Design for de -construction: By consideration of waste minimisation arising from the 
built-form, one of the following should be adopted : 
* Demonstrate that key principles of demountable construction detailing have been 
followed. This could be demonstrated by submitted drawings containing reference 
to guidance such as the Scottish Ecological Design Association's (SEDA) document 
on: 'Design and Detailing for Deconstruction'. A minimum of three of the high or 
medium priority items from the example constructions in the detailed section of this 
document should be demonstrated clearly or  
* Provide a detailed plan for deconstruction of the building t hat follows a template 
such as that on page 21 of the SEDA document. This option provides opportunities 
to meet this level in this aspect for prefabricated, modularised or flexible internally  
* partitioned constructions that use techniques that involve off -site manufacturing 
where the described assembly could be reversed for disassembly or  
* An option only where a site is occupied and the warrant application is for demolition 
and construction. Provide a pre- demolition audit of existing buildings/structures on 
site. In this option for brownfield developments only, the audit should follow an 
established methodology such as the ICE Demolition Protocol, referred to by the 
Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) that:  
 produces a Bill of Quantities of the differen t materials in the building to be 
demolished  
 identifies the tonnages of material that can be recovered and  
 determines the percentage of materials recoverable.  
7.1.7  Carbon dioxide emissions only at Platinum  level  
All the standards in Sections 1 -  6 that ap ply to the building for Bronze level, and in addition 
the building should comply with the following.  
 
################# - Page 490 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 490 Applicable from 5  June 2023  Aspect Platinum 1: Carbon dioxide emissions  
Under the guidance to Standard 6.1, carbon dioxide emissions CO 2 Dwelling Emission Rate 
(DER) is to be 100% lower than the Target Emission Rate (TER) set by the 2010 
Standards. To establish this, the DER should not exceed zero. (This net zero carbon 
equivalent is a 100% improvement on the 2007 Standards).  
Where a building contains more than one dwelling (such as a block of flats or terrace of 
houses) the average carbon dioxide emissions for the proposed block or terrace (DER) may 
be compared to the average target CO 2 emissions (TER) for the 'notional block or terrace', 
similar to guidance in Section 6.  
Where the subject of this assessment is exempt from the calculation of a carbon dioxide 
emission rating under standard 6.1, the Dwelling Delivered Energy Rate (DDER) should be 
assessed instead. To establish 'Platinum', the DDER should not exceed zero.  
Otherwise, as noted in clauses 7.1.4 and 7.1.6, a new home constructed to the 2023 
standards is deemed to achieve 'Gold' for Aspect 1.

Page 491 Applicable from 5  June 2023  7.2 Electric Vehicle Charging  
Mandatory Standard  
Every building must be designed and constructed in such a way that provision 
for the charging of electric vehicles is made where car parking spaces are 
located within the building or the curtilage of the building.  
Limitation  
This standard does not apply to-- 
a) a non- domestic building where ten or fewer car parking spaces are 
present within the building or the curtilage of the building,  
b) alteration to, or extension of a building, other than major renovation 
works.  
 
 
7.2.0 Introduction 
Whilst building regulations do not require the provision of car parking spaces, they do set 
out provisions which are applicable where provision for parking is made as part of the 
development of a building.  This includes a proportion of accessible spaces and means of 
access from parking spaces to the entrance of a building (see standard 4.1).   
Scottish Government p olicy on sustainable transport remains that use of active travel and 
public transport should be promoted first and foremost.  However, it is rec ognised that there 
will be situations where use of a private vehicle, most likely a car, will be required and car 
ownership will continue.   
In recognition of the intent to move away from the ownership and use of internal 
combustion engine vehicles towards  electric vehicles, the provision of charge point sockets 
and enabling infrastructure as part of new building work will support a more sustainable 
approach to development, providing facilities which simplify the transition to electric 
vehicles for building residents, occupiers, visitors and other users.  
It is anticipated that a large number of electric vehicle drivers will choose to charge their 
vehicles at home.  It is therefore now a requirement for  all new homes,  where  external car 
parking is provided, to have access to a charge point socket .  It is co nsidered that , where a 
property has more than one vehicle,  one charge point socket is sufficient  for normal usage 
of these vehicles.  The installation of a proprietary  electric vehicle charging point  socket , not 
a standard electrical outlet, will facilitat e safe and efficient  recharging of vehicles.  The 
provision of electrical infrastructure will also 'future proof ' parking spaces in  response to the 
growing uptake of electric vehicles . 
Installers of electric vehicle charge points should be aware of the need to notify the 
electricity Distribution Network Operator of the intent to undertake such an installation to an 
existing electrical supply or when applying for a new electrical supply.  
Conversions : in the case of conversions, as specified in regulation 4, e very conversion 
which  alters the number dwellings, or the number of building units, in the building,  or which 
changes the occupation or use of : 
################# - Page 492 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 492 Applicable from 5  June 2023  * a residential building to any other type of building, or  
* a building so that it becomes a residential building,  
shall meet the requirements of this standard (regulation 12, schedule 6).  
7.2.1  Charge point provision to new dwellings (including creation of 
one or more dwellings by conversion).  
Single dwellings . 
Where parking, other than a covered car park, is provided within the curtilage of a dwelling, 
a minimum of one electric vehicle charge point socket with an output rating of not less than 
7 kW should be provided adjacent to the parking space.   
Installation should be cost -effective. This is explained  under 'installation cost cap' below.  
Other domestic buildings.  
Where car parking is provided within the curtilage of a domestic building comprising  more 
than one dwelling, e nabling infrastructure (s ee clause 7.2.6) should be provided to each 
parking space wi thin the curtilage of the development site.  
An electric vehicle charge point socket with an output rating of not less than 7 kW should be 
provided per dwelling, subject to the following:    
* An electrical vehicle charge point need not be installed to car par king spaces located 
within a covered car park , which should be excluded from the provisions below.   
* The total number of parking spaces with access to a charge point socket should be the 
lower of the total number of dwellings or the total number of parking spaces provided 
within the curtilage of the development site.  
* Where there are more parking spaces than dwellings, any accessible parking spaces 
(see clause 4.1.1) not already provided with access to an electric vehicle charge point 
socket with an output r ating of not less than 7 kW should be provided with such a 
facility to at least one in every four  (or part thereof)  of such  parking spaces . 
* Installation should be cost -effective. This is explained under 'installation cost cap' 
below.  
In this respect, ' cove red car park' is car parking located within the footprint of a building.  
For example a single dwelling garage or roof -top, open- sided, enclosed or underground car 
park.  
Examples  
* A development of 7 houses each with independent access from a roadway and off -
street parking which can accommodate one or more vehicles.  Each dwelling would be 
provided with access to at least one EV charging point socket adjacent to the parking 
space.  7 individual sockets installed.  
* A development of 25 flats in a single building with shared parking facilities which 
contain 35 parking spaces, two of which are accessible parking spaces.  None are 
within a covered car park. In this example, 26 parking spaces would require access to a 
charge point socket (one socket per dwelling plus one socket per 4 accessible parking 
spaces). The remaining 9 spaces would be provided only with enabling infrastructure.   
################# - Page 493 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 493 Applicable from 5  June 2023  Installation  cost cap.  
For the purpose of this standard, it is deemed cost -effective to install electric vehicle 
charging point  socke ts where the additional cost of providing the associated electrical 
supply to the development site does not exceed an average of PS2,000 (excluding VAT) per 
charge point  socket .  Where this cost cap is exceeded, enabling infrastructure to each 
parking space  should be installed to the extent s described above.  
Where it is identified that the cost of a full installation would exceed the cost cap, the 
applicant should provide at least two written quotations, including one from the Distribution 
Network Operator ( DNO), for the cost of electrical supply to the development site. Each 
quotation should confirm : 
* the overall connection costs for electrical supply to the development both without and 
with electric  vehicle charge point  socket s, confirming the average cost per charge point 
socket for a full implementation; and    
* A statement from the provider confirming the maximum number of  charge point socket s 
which  can be supported at an additional supply  cost not exceeding an average of 
PS2,000 (excluding VAT) per charge point socket. Installation of charge point sockets 
should be undertaken to the extent confirmed by this statement.  
7.2.2  Provision to domestic buildings undergoing major renovation 
works . 
For the purpose of this standard, ' major renovation works ' means works for the renovation 
of a building where ten or more car parking spaces are present within the building or the 
curtilage of the building and where--  
a. more than 25% of the surface area of the building envelope undergoes renovation, and  
b. the works include works to car parking spaces, or the electrical infrastructure of the 
building or of the car parking spaces.  
In this context, 'building envelope' means walls, floor, roof, windows, doors, roof windows 
and roof -lights . 
Note: the following provisions do not apply where the main purpose of the work to the 
building envelope is to improve the fire safety of the building. Such work is considered to be 
remediation rather than renovation.  
Where a domest ic building is subject to 'major renovation works', enabling infrastructure 
(see clause 7.2.6) should be provided to each parking space within the curtilage of the 
development site and an electric vehicle charge point socket with an output rating of not 
less than 7 kW should be provided per dwelling, subject to the following:   
* An electrical vehicle charge point need not be installed to car parking spaces located 
within a covered car park , which should be excluded from the provisions below.   
* The total number of parking spaces with access to a charge point socket should be the 
lower of the total number of dwellings or the total number of parking spaces provided 
within the curtilage of the development site.  
* Where there are more parking spaces than dwellings, any accessible parking spaces 
(see clause 4.1.1) not already provided with access to an electric vehicle charge point 
################# - Page 494 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 494 Applicable from 5  June 2023  socket with an output rating of not less than 7 kW should be provided with such a 
facility to at least one in every four  (or part thereof)  of such  parking spaces . 
* Electric vehicle charge point sockets should be part of an installation where there is 
capacity within the existing electrical supply to the building, post -renovation.  
* Installation should be cost -effective. This is explained under 'defined cost limit' below.  
In this respect, ' covered car park' is car parking located within the footprint of a building.  
For example a single dwelling garage or roof -top, open- sided, enclosed or underground car 
park.  
Defined cost limit.  
For the purpose of this standard, installation is deemed cost -effective where the cost of 
providing the installation does not exceed 7% of the total capital cost of the major 
renovation works. This defined cost limit  includ es the provision of enabling infr astructure, 
charge point  sockets and other equipment needed for the operation of installed charge 
point sockets .  
The cost set out should be the cost of materials and labour, excluding VAT. Calculation of 
the percentage of project costs should compare the cost of the electric vehicle charge point  
socket s, cable routes  and other equipment  to the total cost of the major renovation 
including those additional works. The cost should exclude land or property costs, statutory 
fees or any other development costs.  
Where it is determined that  electric vehicle charge point sockets can be installed without the 
need to upgrade the building electrical supply, this should form part of the installation.  The 
developer may then determine the preferred extent of installation of enabling infrastructure 
and charge point sockets  without exceeding the defined cost limit.  
7.2.3  Mixed Development  
Where work is undertaken to form both domestic and non- domestic buildings, the 
assignment of car parking within the curtilage of the site  to each category of building should 
be set out in the building warrant application.  P rovisions from the Domestic and Non-
domestic Technical Handbooks for e lectric vehicle charging should then be applied 
accordingly.  
7.2.4  Location of charge points. 
Charge points should be located outwith any surfaces  used as an access route and should 
not present an obstruction to pedestrians , cyclists or vehicles. Location of charge points 
should enable charging to take place without charging cables crossing or otherwise 
obstructing pedestrian, cycle or vehicle  routes , including drop kerbs between road and 
pedestrian surfaces .  
Charge points should be positioned in relation to parking spaces to minimise the risk of 
accidental damage, for example, from vehicles projecting over kerbs. Where a protective 
barrier is provided, this should not impede the use of the charge point.  
Where a charge point serves more than one parking space it should be provided with one 
charge point socket per parking space (with each socket able to deliver a minimum of 7 kW 
simultaneously) and should enable safe and convenient use of all outlets at the same time.

Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 495 Applicable from 5  June 2023  To enable installation, maintenance and ease of use:  
* Floor mounted charge points should be installed so that there is not less than 1500 mm 
between the sides , and 500 mm between the rear , of the charge point enclosure and 
any adjacent wall or similar obstruction.  
* Wall mounted charge points should be installed so that there is not less than 800 mm 
between the charge point enclosure and any adjacent wall or similar obstruction. 
Charge points should be installed with the lower edge of the charge point enclosure 
between 700 mm and 1000 mm from floor level.  
Additional guidance on delivering accessible charge points is provided within PAS 
1899:2022 - 'Electric vehicles -  Accessible charging -  Specification '. 
Installations should meet the requirements of BS 7671 and the I ET's 'Code of Practice: 
Electric Vehicle Charging Equipment Installation' . 
7.2.5  Specification of electric vehicle charge points.  
Electrical vehicle charge points should be designed and installed to the standards set out 
under BS EN 61851 -  'Electric vehicle conductive charging system '.  Installed c harge points 
should : 
* Have charge point sockets with a nominal rated output of not less  than 7 kW . A charge 
point with multiple sockets should be capable of providing this output from each socket 
simultaneously ; 
* Be fitted with a universal socket (also known as an untethered electric vehicle charge 
point);  
* Be fitted with an indicator to show the equipment's charging status that uses lights, or a 
visual display; and  
* Be a minimum of a Mode 3 specialised system for electric vehicle charging running 
from a dedicated circuit, or equivalent, as defined in BS EN IEC 61851- 1. 
Installations should meet  the requirements of BS 7671 and the IET's ' Code of Practice: 
Electric Vehicle Charging Equipment Installation' . 
7.2.6 Enabling infrastructure and future charge points.  
Duct installations should be provided from a suitable electricity supply at the building or 
elsewhere within the development site to the installation position for each charge point and 
future charge point location.  The design of the installation should identify and make 
provision for any intermediate switchgear or other control apparatus needed to manage the 
distribution of the electrical supply to each charge point or future charge point location.  
Installations should meet the requirements of BS 7671 and the IET's ' Code of Practice: 
Electric Vehicle Charging Equipment Installation' . 
The si ze, specification and bend radius of all cable ducts should be based upon the 
confirmed type of  cabling needed to meet the required power supply at outlets .  
Underground cable duct installations should meet BS EN 61386 -24 -'Conduit systems for 
cable management - Particular requirements. Conduit systems buried underground'.  All 
cable ducts should meet the positioning and colour -coding standards in the N ational Joint 
################# - Page 496 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 496 Applicable from 5  June 2023  Utilities Group ' Guidelines on the Positioning and Colour Coding of Underground Utilities' 
Apparatus' .  
The point where a cable duct enters a building should be sealed to prevent water ingress 
and attack by vermin, and to comply with all relevant Building Regulations requirements .  
Where a charge point is not fitted as part of initial work, enabl ing infrastructure should be 
provided to the extents noted in clauses 7.2 1 & 7.2.2.  This should enable the installation of 
charge points and any intermediate control equipment without the need for additional 
builder work other than at the equipment insta llation points.  
The termination points of cable ducts should be located to provide adequate space for 
future installation and ongoing maintenance of a charge point, as noted in clause 7.2.4.    
Termination points for future connections should be weather sealed but clearly identified 
and accessible. Location of future charge points should be identified by durable, 
weatherproof signage, with text not less than 25 mm high noting "Dedicated position for 
electric vehicle charge point".  
7.2.7  Information on the installation and operation of charge points  
Written information on the installation of a charge point should be provided as part of the 
'quick start' documentation for each dwelling produced under standard 6.8.   
Where installed to serve a single dwelling or connected to the electrical supply of a single 
dwelling, this should include information on the charge point, the socket itself, the 
connection of the charge point back to the building electrical supply and means of isolation 
and a summary of how to use the facility. A copy of the commissioning information for the 
charge point(s) and any associated control equipment and manufacturer's literature on 
installed products should also be provided.  
Where otherwise installed within a communal car park, information on the location of all 
installed ductwork and equipment should be provided, also identifying all enabling 
infrastructure which will support the addition of charge points in the future.   
A copy of the commissioning information for the charge point(s) and  any associated control 
equipment and manufacturer's literature on installed products should also be provided.

Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 498 Applicable from 5  June 2023  Annex 7.B Supplementary guidance in the aspect of 
optimising performance  
7.B.0  Introduction 
The quick start guide (QSG) should be produced in 2- stages:  
* at building warrant application submit as much information as possible including the 
plan, an outline of the construction and building fabric, specified systems or equipment 
and any other environmental features and  
* re-submit at completion after review and updating of specified items as necessary.  
A good practice example of the QSG is on the Scottis h Government website at How your 
low carbon home works -  gov.scot (www.gov.scot) . 
7.B.1  Scope  
The QSG should be specific to each individual dwelling. Where there are a number of 
houses or flats of the same type, it is likely that the information could be repeated for each 
type, taking care to ensure correct orientation of plans and correct positions of installed 
items on the plan.  
The purpose i s not to explain details of how or why a home is designed to work 
environmentally, but rather what occupiers need to know to make a home work efficiently. It 
should describe the overall performance of the dwelling as a system itself. The focus should 
be on maintaining internal comfort in an efficient manner. Do not include unnecessary detail 
on the operation of the individual elements or systems of technology.  
7.B.2  Format  
The QSG should be as compact and graphic as possible to aid rapid comprehension, 
maki ng it more likely to be kept available, used for future reference and be capable of being 
passed on to future owners or residents.  
A variety of formats could be used to convey the information but it should be a free-  
standing document, separate from other documentation (but including directions to further 
information). It may be designed to meet a similar graphic standard of other material which 
is provided at completion. The recommended formats are:  
* an A4 guide of maximum 6 pages, preferably 4 or less or  
* a booklet with page sizes smaller than A4, possibly with double page spreads such as 
the booklet in the first good practice example.  
Better design and construction of control mechanisms should make systems more intuitive 
and reduce the need for guidance, th erefore please be very concise if appropriate.  
7.B.3  Graphics, images and  text 
The QSG should include plans, locating key items of equipment and information only on the 
systems installed. The format should revolve around simple illustrations following the 
principle - 'show don't tell'. An illustration can be a hand- drawn sketch, a computer image 
################# - Page 499 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 499 Applicable from 5  June 2023  or a photograph. These can be mixed because consistency in style is less important than 
content. Illustrations do not need to be to scale, but should show relations hips and explain 
things quickly and easily. These guidelines should be followed:  
* Use illustration where possible to focus the occupant on the equipment that users 
normally come into contact with. For example, the programmer in the heating section 
should show where it is placed in relation to the boiler.  
* Link key components (such as heating controls) to a location plan to help the resident to 
make connections between controls and systems quickly  
* Images should be labelled.  
* Avoid non- essential images (e.g. lifestyle image) which can reduce the authority of the 
document.  
* Use graphic formats that preserve the sharpness of lines, such as PDF.  
* Illustrations should be associated with a legible caption of standard size and colour.  
* Many people have difficulty understanding plans, so use other images, for example a 
simple 3D diagram alongside plans to aid comprehension.  
* Use colour where possible as an easy way to differentiate categories visually. However 
readers may be colour  blind, so use icons, illustrations and high contrast type.  
* Text size should aim to be at least 11pt but can be of smaller sizes in annotations, 
labels or text boxes if a typeface designed for text reading at small sizes is used. Make 
headings as large as possible.  
* Use clear, colour, photographs (well lit, avoid use of flash if possible) or line illustrations 
of actual installed equipment.  
* Use engineer's or manufacturer's drawings as reference in order to comprehend the 
system but edit these to remove unnec essary items. Do not attempt to replace the 
manufacturer's manuals, but do refer to them for further information. The main elements 
or products should be identified with their full names/reference model numbers and links 
to more information such as manuals  or manufacturers websites.  
* Use plain English avoiding detailed technical descriptions.  
* Use bullet points where possible.  
* Avoid jargon and acronyms. If an acronym is necessary define it on first use. In the 
good practice example MVHR (Mechanical Ventilatio n Heat Recovery system) is used 
because the acronym is more likely to lead to success in internet searches for more 
information.  
7.B.4  DOs and  DON'Ts  
Provide a brief list of up to 5 essential DOs and DON'Ts for occupant interaction with each 
system (heatin g, ventilation etc). This should be specific to the heating system installed and 
ideally, in a colour coded text box, in a consistent position on the page. General guidance is 
available on the Energy Saving Trust website: http:// www.energysavingtrust.org. uk/. 
 
 
################# - Page 500 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 500 Applicable from 5  June 2023  7.B.5  Sections  
Aim to fit a section relating to each of the following categories on the equivalent of a single 
A4 sheet, or less where possible.  
a. Overview  
Give a brief description of the basic features of the house, including insulation, building 
fabric, heating, ventilation, hot water use and any major equipment that make a 
difference to how the house operates. Avoid large paragraphs. Keep to between 100 to 
150 words.  
The overview page should include the following sentence: This guide is produced to 
meet the aspect of 'Optimising Performance' within Section 7: Sustainability of the 
Building Standards Technical Handbooks.  
Locate key parts of the equipment, annotated on a legible plan or other illustration. 
Plans should be simple and clear, generally 'planning application' standard with walls 
blacked in, dimensions and unnecessary annotation removed in the CAD program. 
Showing fittings such as bathrooms and kitchens on layouts can assist. Limitations on 
alterations due to the construction (e.g. avoid hol es in external walls that penetrate the 
vapour barrier) can be mentioned here. Use 3D plan perspectives, axonometric 
diagrams, or cutaway models to aid understanding. Items to be shown include:  
* Key elements of the construction and materials -  roof, walls, windows and doors  
* Elements of heating, hot water and ventilation equipment  
* Heat element devices  
* Control locations  
* Meters  
* Water stop- cock 
If the dwelling has achieved a silver, gold or platinum level, it is permissible to use the 
associated 'badge' on the overview page of the front cover.  
b. Heating  
Describe how the home can be heated including aspects of the building fabric and 
ventilation that are relevant to how the system works. Cover the main principles of use 
in both warm and cold weather. Simple diagrams illustrating how the building is heated 
in both winter and summer are useful. Avoid engineering heating system schematics as 
many people find these hard to understand.  
Describe in around 50- 100 words the main heating source in the home, including the 
principles of operation and fuel source if relevant. Supplementary heating sources 
should be mentioned, where included. Provide a brief description of how heat reaches 
rooms e.g. radiators, underfloor heating, air grilles, with illustrations provided as 
required.  
Briefly describe how heating is controlled. Illustrations and locations are required for all 
the main controls. Identify the reaction to heating controls (for example there may be a 
time lag before a heating system operates at optimum capacity) and outline the normal 
range if this is not obvious.  
 
################# - Page 501 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 501 Applicable from 5  June 2023  c. Ventilation  
Describe in around 50- 100 words how the home is ventilated and the main principles 
for its use, in both warm and cold weather. Simple diagrams illustrating how the building 
is ventilated in wi nter and summer are useful.  
Briefly describe how the ventilation is controlled with illustrations and locations required 
for all the main controls. This should include both natural and mechanical systems. 
Identify the elements that users have the most interaction with, so in natural ventilation, 
it may be trickle vents and opening of windows together with a reference to cross 
ventilation. For mechanical ventilation it may be the boost switch and location of filters.  
d. Hot Water  
Provide up to 50- 100 words on how water is heated in the homes, including primary 
and secondary systems (for example a boiler working with solar hot water panels). 
Consider a simple diagram illustrating how the system works if it has a number of 
components or options.  
Briefly describe how hot water generation is controlled. Illustrate the controls, identify the 
reaction to hot water controls (for example there may be a time lag before a hot water 
system operates at optimum capacity) and outline the normal range if this is not obvious.  
e. Other Energy Saving Features  (if installed)  
Cover any other energy saving feature installed as part of the fabric of the home or 
included in the SAP calculation. Include instructions for items not covered elsewhere. 
Each item should have a brief (around 50 w ords) description of other energy saving 
features. Identify for each item:  
* Name or description  
* Location  
* How to control it and where the controls are located  
* Manufacturer and model number  
* Location of further information such as a manual or specific website address  
f. How to maintain systems  
A 'how to keep your home running efficiently' section should provide an easy to 
understand list of maintenance required for systems outlined in the guide. It must only 
include items that residents should be undertaking without tools or specialist 
knowledge. In particular consider including the following information:  
* List of equipment names/serial numbers  
* Links to further detailed information  
* Manufacturers websites  
* Recommended servicing organisations  
7.B.6  Labels (applicable to Gold level  only)  
Provide labels fixed to all components of heating, ventilation and hot water, including 
controls. Use a consistent naming convention and colour coding. These labels should be 
colour coded to match the booklet colour scheme and text size about 11pt. Avoid small font 
sizes. The labels should indicate 'standard' setting for items or equipment.

Page 518 Applicable from 5  June 2023  Appendix B list of standards and other  
publications  
The Construction Products Regulation  
The Construction Products Regulation (CPR), in force in the UK on 1 July 2013 permits 
the use of a wide range of standards and specifications recognised throughout the 
European Economic Area (EEA) (see Note 1).  
Standards of safety, suitability and fitness measured against factors commo n throughout 
Europe are intended to avoid unnecessary barriers to trade. The European Standards 
body (CEN), see clause 0.8.2 produce harmonised European Standards (EN) to replace 
the variety of standards used throughout Member States (see Note 2). These EN s have 
been or will be published in the UK by the British Standards Institution (BSI) as a BS EN. 
Once a BS EN is published, the old BS will co- exist for a transitional period (usually one 
year) with the corresponding BS. Until the BS EN comes into force b oth BS and BS EN 
may be referenced. At the end of the transitional period the BS is withdrawn and the BS 
EN must be adopted.  
The complex processes involved in the production of European Standards can create 
lengthy development times. European Standards in draft form are termed prEN and are 
released into the public domain when they are issued for consultation. It has been found 
necessary, occasionally, to reference prEN in the Technical Handbooks where no other 
suitable document yet exists.  
Any reference in the Technical Handbooks to a British Standard (BS), British Standard 
Code of Practice (CP), European Standard (BS EN or prEN) or International Standard (BS 
EN ISO) is to a standard published by BSI. Where a revision or a newer standard has 
since been produced, this newer version may be used as an alternative, unless otherwise 
stated in the handbooks. Any reference in the handbooks to a particular requirement or 
recommendation of such a standard should be taken, unless the context otherwise 
requires, as incl uding reference to any relevant commentary and defined terminology 
contained in that standard. Attention is also drawn to the status accorded to standards and 
specifications recognised elsewhere in the EEA which provide an equivalent standard -  
see the gui dance to Regulation 8, Materials, durability and workmanship. Compliance with 
the standards contained in publications in this category represent compliance with the 
appropriate standards referred to elsewhere in the handbooks and is acceptable until a 
relevant harmonised standard is introduced.  
Harmonised test methods have been agreed collectively by Member States and CEN on 
the basis of the implications of health and safety of the product and on the particular 
nature and production process for the product itself. Certification, inspection and testing of 
construction products is carried out by notified bodies who have been appointed for the 
purpose by a Member State and whose name has been notified to the European 
Commission. The British Board of Agrement (B BA) is a notified body for certain products. 
Any reference in the handbooks to a certificate issued by a notified body or to a BBA 
Certificate should be construed as reference to the current certificate.  
Any reference in the handbooks to a publication should be construed as a reference to that 
publication as detailed in Column 1 of the list of publications given in this Appendix, 
subject to such amendments, supplements or addenda as are detailed in the list.  
################# - Page 519 -  ##################
Domestic Technical Handbook  June 2023 Edition  
 
 
Page 519 Applicable from 5  June 2023  Where a publication referred to in the handbooks  itself refers to another publication, the 
reference to such other publication should be considered to be a reference to the latest 
edition including any amendments, supplements or addenda.  
Where the standards listed in this Appendix have been amended or r eplaced since the 
publication of the handbooks, it is no longer necessary to await the publication of updated 
guidance. The verifier can accept a design to the new standard if it considers the relevant 
expanded functional standard is met.  
Note 1. The Europ ean Economic Area Agreement is given affect in the UK by the 
European Economic Area Act 1993 and entered into force on 1 January 1994.

European Free Trade Association and is a contracting party to the European Economic 
Area Agreement.
